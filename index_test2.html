The Real Planet of the Apes makes the explosive claim that it was in Europe, not Africa, where apes evolved the most important hallmarks of our human lineage--such as bipedalism, dexterous hands, and larger brains. In this compelling and accessible book, David Begun, one of the world's leading paleoanthropologists, transports readers to an epoch in the remote past when the Earth was home to many migratory populations of ape species. Drawing on the latest astonishing discoveries in the fossil record as well as his own experiences conducting field expeditions across Europe and Asia, Begun provides a sweeping evolutionary history of great apes and humans. He tells the story of how one of the earliest members of our evolutionary group--a new kind of primate called Proconsul--evolved from lemur-like monkeys in the primeval forests of Africa. Begun vividly describes how, over the next 10 million years, these hominoids expanded into Europe and Asia and evolved climbing and hanging adaptations, longer maturation times, and larger brains, setting the stage for the emergence of humans.","OCLC":"920541382","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":13,"ControlNumber":"953654","Title":"Shaler's fish.","Author":"Macdonald, Helen.","Publisher":"[Place of publication not identified] : Atlantic Monthly, 2016.","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2016","ISBN":"0802124631","Description":"p. cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"913304901","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":14,"ControlNumber":"953656","Title":"United.","Author":"Booker, Cory.","Publisher":"[Place of publication not identified] : Ballantine, 2016.","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2016","ISBN":"1101965169","Description":"","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"911594074","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":15,"ControlNumber":"953657","Title":"Wait till i'm dead : uncollected poems.","Author":"","Publisher":"[S.l.] : Grove, 2016.","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2016","ISBN":"0802124534","Description":"","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"911364931","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":16,"ControlNumber":"953658","Title":"Widening income inequality : poems","Author":"Seidel, Frederick, 1936-","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2016","ISBN":"9780374250843 (hardcover)","Description":"pages ; cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Frederick Seidel has been called many things.

No one in the world of business-not Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Warren Buffett-has been as famous as Trump for as long. First associated with high-profile real estate development in 1970s Manhattan, his name has since become synonymous with success defined by wealth and luxury. What does one make of a grown man who, when he argues with women, stoops to insulting their appearance and habitually courts controversy? What if the same man were among the most prominent people in the world, and a privately generous person who once handed a dying child a $50,000 check so that he could enjoy the last months of his life? Add to the picture a kind of resilience that has allowed him to stage countless comebacks and truly a boundless level of optimism, and you get a figure so compelling that he cannot be dismissed simply because of his personality,\"--Novelist.","OCLC":"907965721","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":25,"ControlNumber":"950321","Title":"Steel Kiss.","Author":"Deaver, Jeffery.","Publisher":"Grand Central 2016.","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2016","ISBN":"9781455536344","Description":"448 p.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":11,"CurrentHoldRequests":35,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"913098518","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":26,"ControlNumber":"950322","Title":"NYPD Red 4.","Author":"Patterson, James.","Publisher":"Little, Brown & Co. 2016.","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2016","ISBN":"9780316407069","Description":"400 p.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":29,"CurrentHoldRequests":124,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"913098440","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":27,"ControlNumber":"950323","Title":"Gone again : a Jack Swyteck novel","Author":"Grippando, James, 1958- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2016","ISBN":"9780062368706","Description":"pages ; cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":9,"CurrentHoldRequests":13,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"910983801","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":28,"ControlNumber":"950324","Title":"Girl's guide to moving on.","Author":"Macomber, Debbie.","Publisher":"[Place of publication not identified] : Ballantine, 2016.","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2016","ISBN":"0553391925","Description":"","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":14,"CurrentHoldRequests":53,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"911171893","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":29,"ControlNumber":"950325","Title":"The Gangster : an Isaac Bell adventure","Author":"Cussler, Clive, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2016","ISBN":"9780399175954","Description":"pages ; cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":13,"CurrentHoldRequests":34,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"It is 1906, and in New York City, the Italian crime group known as the Black Hand is on a spree: kidnapping, extortion, arson.

Dennis Mira just had two unpleasant surprises. First he learned that his cousin Edward was secretly meeting with a real estate agent about their late grandfather's magnificent West Village brownstone, despite the promise they both made to keep it in the family. Then, when he went to the house to confront Edward about it, he got a blunt object to the back of the head. Luckily Dennis is married to Charlotte Mira, the NYPSD's top profiler and a good friend of Lieutenant Eve Dallas. When the two arrive on the scene, he explains that the last thing he saw was Edward in a chair, bruised and bloody. When he came to, his cousin was gone. With the mess cleaned up and the security disks removed, there's nothing left behind but a few traces for forensics to analyze. As a former lawyer, judge, and senator, Edward Mira mingled with the elite and crossed paths with criminals, making enemies on a regular basis. Like so many politicians, he also made some very close friends behind closed--and locked--doors. But a badge and a billionaire husband can get you into places others can't go, and Eve intends to shine some light on the dirty deals and dark motives behind the disappearance of a powerful man, the family discord over a multimillion-dollar piece of real estate . . . and a new case that no one saw coming\" -- provided by publisher.","OCLC":"907391195","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Robb, J.

Addie Baum is The Boston Girl, born in 1900 to immigrant parents who were unprepared for and suspicious of America and its effect on their three daughters. Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie's intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can't imagine--a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture, and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love. Eighty-five-year-old Addie tells the story of her life to her twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, who has asked her \"How did you get to be the woman you are today.\" She begins in 1915, the year she found her voice and made friends who would help shape the course of her life. From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the naive girl she was and a wicked sense of humor. Written with the same attention to historical detail and emotional resonance that made Anita Diamant's previous novels bestsellers, The Boston Girl is a moving portrait of one woman's complicated life in twentieth century America, and a fascinating look at a generation of women finding their places in a changing world\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"884882199","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":73,"ControlNumber":"890160","Title":"Knocked : a Regan Reilly mystery","Author":"Clark, Carol Higgins. author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781476710518","Description":"pages ; cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":11,"CurrentHoldRequests":19,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"When Detective Regan Reilly sets off for her tenth reunion at Quiltier College--an all-women's college in Northern Massachusetts--she is looking forward to reconnecting with old friends and reminiscing.

Whether modern or ancient, every culture has its myths. Mythology forms our understanding of our origin, history, and traditions. They tell of our heroes and deities. Myths are vehicles for understanding religion, for learning language, and for understanding society, but they can often be difficult to understand and confusing. The Handy Mythology Answer Book examines and explains, in plain English, numerous myths and mythology. From the ancient Greek and Roman to Egypt and Babylon, from Native North American Indian to Celtic, Middle Eastern, Indian, Asian, African, and the lesser known myths from around the world, The Handy Mythology Answer Book has them covered. Whether it is the modern retelling of a classic myth or an ancient story about a Norse god, this helpful resource demystifies the myth, looks at different archetypes and motifs, and even shows how myths help explain our existence and institutions. It answers nearly 600 questions and offers fun facts about the treachery and violence, the inspirational and epic, the supernatural monsters and heroic mortals found in mythology, such as How and when did myths originate? What are the three primary myth types? What is the nature of Creation Myths? How can myths be compared to dreams? Why do humans tell myths? What was the Egyptian Book of the Dead? How is the epic of Gilgamesh like later epics? Why is the biblical flood story so like the Babylonian flood myth? What was the myth of Theseus, the Labyrinth, and the Minotaur? What are the Homeric Hymns? How and why are the Odyssey and the Iliad so different from each other? What is the popular appeal of the Odyssey? Did the Greeks see these myths as religion or as entertainment? What was the background myth of the Oedipus plays? What was the nature of Roman mythology during the Roman Republic? What was the Metamorphosis? How did Christian narrative and tradition fit into and come to dominate the Roman mythological tradition? How is Celtic culture and mythology related to the culture and mythology of Greek, Roman, and other cultures? How did the Vedas contribute to Hindu mythology? Who invented Chinese writing? What was the Aztec pantheon? What is the story of the Cherokee Grandmother Sun? Who are some Native American tricksters? What is the story of Schrödinger's Cat? How did Freud use myths? How is myth used in politics? A glossary of commonly used terms and an appendix of parallel mythology exploring universal themes, motifs, and archetypes from across various cultures further explains the world of mythology. \"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"869266644","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":82,"ControlNumber":"894374","Title":"500 regulation questions for the CPA exam","Author":"Stefano, Denise M., author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780071820943","Description":"vii, 227 pages ; 23 cm","WebLink":"http:\/\/catdir.loc.gov\/catdir\/enhancements\/fy1405\/2014932388-d.html","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"839388295","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"McGraw-Hill's 500 questions series.","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"McGraw-Hill's 500 questions series.\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":83,"ControlNumber":"895740","Title":"Chase your shadow : the trials of oscar pistorius.","Author":"Carlin, John.","Publisher":"[S.l.] : Harpercollins, 2015.","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"0062297066","Description":"","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"880237222","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":84,"ControlNumber":"895936","Title":"A fine summer's day","Author":"Todd, Charles.","Publisher":"New York : William Morrow, [2015]","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"0062237128","Description":"358 pages : map ; 24 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"FICTION TOD","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":2,"LocalItemsTotal":2,"SystemItemsIn":30,"SystemItemsTotal":36,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"On a fine summer's day in June, 1914, Ian Rutledge pays little notice to the assassination of an archduke in Sarajevo. An Inspector at Scotland Yard, he is planning to propose to the woman whom he deeply loves, despite intimations from friends and family that she may not be the wisest choice. To the north on this warm and gentle day, another man in love - a Scottish Highlander - shows his own dear girl the house he will build for her in September. While back in England, a son awaits the undertaker in the wake of his widowed mother's death. This death will set off a series of murders across England, seemingly unconnected, that Rutledge will race to solve in the weeks before the fateful declaration in August that will forever transform his world. As the clouds of war gather on the horizon, all of Britain wonders and waits. With every moment at stake, Rutledge sets out to right a wrong - an odyssey that will eventually force him to choose between the Yard and his country, between love and duty, and between honor and truth.","OCLC":"878109390","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Todd, Charles.

Has she declared cyber war on the United States or was her \"Angel Worm\" intended only to free the victims of Australia's immigration policies? Is she innocent? Can she be saved? The answers are up to law-suit-magnet journalist Felix Moore, a.k.a. Felix Moore-or-less-correct. His career is tanking when he gets this chance to write a biography that will vindicate the young woman. Funding is to be provided by an old friend--an outrageous millionaire property developer--and further impetus by an old flame: the young woman's actress mother whom Felix worshiped when they were at university together.

Scott Fitzgerald's last years in Hollywood In 1937, F. Scott Fitzgerald was a troubled, uncertain man whose literary success was long over. In poor health, with his wife consigned to a mental asylum and his finances in ruins, he struggled to make a new start as a screenwriter in Hollywood. By December 1940, he would be dead of a heart attack. Those last three years of Fitzgerald's life, often obscured by the legend of his earlier Jazz Age glamour, are the focus of Stewart O'Nan's gorgeously and gracefully written novel. With flashbacks to key moments from Fitzgerald's past, the story follows him as he arrives on the MGM lot, falls in love with brassy gossip columnist Sheilah Graham, begins work on The Last Tycoon, and tries to maintain a semblance of family life with the absent Zelda and daughter, Scottie. Fitzgerald's orbit of literary fame and the Golden Age of Hollywood is brought vividly to life through the novel's romantic cast of characters, from Dorothy Parker and Ernest Hemingway to Humphrey Bogart. A sympathetic and deeply personal portrait of a flawed man who never gave up in the end, even as his every wish and hope seemed thwarted, West of Sunset confirms O'Nan as \"possibly our best working novelist\" (Salon)\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881093812","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":87,"ControlNumber":"894847","Title":"A history of global consumption : 1500-1800","Author":"Baghdiantz McCabe, Ina, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780415507912 (hardback)","Description":"x, 301 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Examines the history of consumption throughout the early modern period.

Since 2002, Mohamedou Slahi has been imprisoned at the detainee camp at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. In all these years, the United States has never charged him with a crime. Although he was ordered released by a federal judge, the U.S. government fought that decision, and there is no sign that the United States plans to let him go. Three years into his captivity Slahi began a diary, recounting his life before he disappeared into U.S. custody and daily life as a detainee. His diary is not merely a vivid record of a miscarriage of justice, but a deeply personal memoir--terrifying, darkly humorous, and surprisingly gracious.

Instead of relying on the woodcuts of dissected bodies in old medical texts, physicians opened bodies themselves to see what was there; instead of divining truth through the authority of an ancient holy book or philosophical treatise, people began to explore the book of nature for themselves through travel and exploration; instead of the supernatural belief in the divine right of kings, people employed a natural belief in the right of democracy. In this provocative and compelling book, Shermer will explain how abstract reasoning, rationality, empiricism, skepticism--scientific ways of thinking--have profoundly changed the way we perceive morality and, indeed, move us ever closer to a more just world\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881041834","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":103,"ControlNumber":"899712","Title":"Mind change : how digital technologies are leaving their mark on our brains","Author":"Greenfield, Susan.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780812993820 (hardback)","Description":"xvii, 348 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":6,"SystemItemsTotal":8,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Google. Facebook. Twitter. Repeat. We live in a world unimaginable even a few decades ago, one like no other in human history. It's a parallel world where we can be on the move in the real world, yet always hooked into an alternative time and place. And although it's a two-dimensional world of sight and sound, it offers instant information, connected identities, and constant novelty. In this world, our screen technologies are increasingly where we work, where we unwind, where we relieve our boredom and where we learn. The subsequent transformation in how we live and think is a vitally important issue, perhaps even the most important issue of our time. When toddlers are given iPads, and adults spend ten hours a day staring at a screen, can we afford to assume that our brave new screen technologies are harmless tools? Blending a wide range of scientific studies, news events, and cultural criticism with brio and verve, Mind Change presents an incisive snapshot of the global 'now.' Greenfield examines how the dawn of the Digital Age has already altered our cultural landscape, fueled an epidemic of oversharing, and transformed how we learn, remember and spread information -- and how these innovations are changing our physical brains. A warning cry, a shot across the bow, and a call to action, Mind Change explores the social, cultural and physiological ramifications of our new digital lifestyle\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881469410","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":104,"ControlNumber":"899716","Title":"Thieves of state : why corruption threatens global security","Author":"Chayes, Sarah, 1962-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780393239461 (hardcover)","Description":"262 pages : illustrations ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":5,"SystemItemsTotal":5,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"880566167","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":105,"ControlNumber":"899717","Title":"Resilience : two sisters and a story of mental illness","Author":"Close, Jessie.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781455548828 (hardback)","Description":"306 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":13,"SystemItemsTotal":13,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"The Close sisters are descended from very prominent and wealthy ancestors. When the Close sisters were very young, their parents joined a cult called the MRA, or Moral Rearmament. The family was suddenly uprooted to a cult school in Switzerland and, ultimately, to the Belgian Congo where their father became a surgeon in the war ravaged republic, and ultimately the personal physician to President Mobutu. Shortly after the girls returned to the US for boarding school, Jessie first started to exhibit symptoms of severe bipolar disorder (she would later learn that this ran in the family, a well-kept secret). Jessie embarked on a series of destructive marriages as the condition worsened. Glenn was always by her side, going so far as to adopt Jessie's daughter when Jessie was abandoned by the child's father. Jessie's mental illness was passed on to her son, Calen. It wasn't until Calen entered McLean's psychiatric hospital that Jessie herself was diagnosed. Fifteen years and twelve years of sobriety later, Jessie is a stable and productive member of society. Glenn continues to be the major support in Jessie's life. In RESILIENCE, the sisters share their story of triumphing over Jessie's illness. The book is written in Jessie's voice with running commentary and an epilogue written by Glenn\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"879602879","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":106,"ControlNumber":"899718","Title":"American dreams : restoring economic opportunity for everyone","Author":"Rubio, Marco, 1971-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781595231130 (hardback)","Description":"xxi, 212 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"330.973 RUB","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":10,"SystemItemsTotal":11,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"A bold plan to help the middle class, by the New York Times bestselling author of An American Son. For generations, the belief that if you work hard you can offer your children a better life has been known as the American Dream. That dream is on life support today, and not just because of the economic downturn and bad leadership from Washington. America has undergone an economic transformation that our schools, our workers, and too many of our families are unequipped for. But our leaders in Washington have broken their promise to lead us together into this new era. Their response has been to double down on stale, government-centered solutions, minimum wage hikes, and redistributive health care mandates that re-slice a shrinking economic pie instead of growing it for everyone. All while free enterprise is demonized and work is discouraged. Now Senator Rubio shares the stories of real people who are fighting to educate their children, protect their families, climb the economic ladder, save for retirement, and achieve their own American dreams. He challenges us to replace our failing 20th century institutions with a new agenda based on choice, innovation and local control. \"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"892213164","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":107,"ControlNumber":"899722","Title":"It was me all along : a memoir","Author":"Mitchell, Andie.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780770433246","Description":"232 pages ; 22 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":17,"SystemItemsTotal":18,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"859253071","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":108,"ControlNumber":"899817","Title":"Becoming Richard Pryor","Author":"Saul, Scott.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780062123305","Description":"586 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":7,"SystemItemsTotal":7,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"869267234","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":109,"ControlNumber":"900163","Title":"Advanced R","Author":"Wickham, Hadley, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781466586963","Description":"xxii, 456 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"881664644","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Chapman & Hall\/CRC the R series (CRC Press)","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Chapman & Hall\/CRC the R series (CRC Press)\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":110,"ControlNumber":"899776","Title":"The Cooperstown chronicles : baseball's colorful characters, unusual lives, and strange demises","Author":"Russo, Frank, 1959-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781442236394 (cloth : alk. paper)","Description":"289 pages : illustrations ; 23 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"888985577","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":111,"ControlNumber":"899895","Title":"Ultimate guide to Facebook advertising","Author":"Marshall, Perry S.","Publisher":"","Edition":"Second edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781599185460 (paperback)","Description":"xiv, 327 pages : illustrations ; 26 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Covering the latest and breaking news in Facebook advertising, this updated edition introduces revised, expanded, and new chapters covering fundamentals, Newsfeed ads, sidebar ads, and BIG data.

Facing down this anniversary, Johann Hari was witnessing a close relative and an ex-boyfriend bottoming out on cocaine and heroin. But what was the big picture in the war on drugs? Why does it continue, when most people now think it has failed? The reporter set out on a two-year, 20,000-mile journey through the theater of this war--to find out how it began, how it has affected people around the world, and how we can move beyond it. Chasing the Scream is fueled by dramatic personal stories of the people he meets along the way: A transsexual crack dealer in Brooklyn who wanted to know who killed her mother, and a mother in Mexico who spent years tracking her daughter's murderer across the desert. A child smuggled out of the Jewish ghetto during the Holocaust who helped unlock the scientific secrets of addiction. A doctor who pushed the decriminalization in Portugal of all drugs - from cannabis to crack. The title itself comes from a formative story of Harry Anslinger, first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, sent as a boy to the pharmacy for a neighbor screaming in withdrawal -- an experience which led him to fear drugs without regard to context. Always we come back to the front lines in the U.S., where we instigated the war and exported it around the globe, but where change is also coming. Powerful, propulsive, and persuasive, Chasing the Scream is the page-turning story of a century-long mistake, which shows us the way to a more humane future\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881418255","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":123,"ControlNumber":"902626","Title":"One thousand things worth knowing : poems","Author":"Muldoon, Paul.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780374227128 (hardback)","Description":"117 pages ; 22 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"A new collection of poems by Pulitzer Prize-winner Paul Muldoon\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881318288","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":124,"ControlNumber":"902533","Title":"My iPad","Author":"Rosenzweig, Gary, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"Seventh edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780789753465","Description":"xiii, 467 pages : illustrations (chiefly color) ; 23 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":1,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"My iPad, Seventh Edition, helps you quickly get started with your new tablet, and use its features to look up information and perform day-to-day activities from anywhere, any time.","OCLC":"895710605","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":125,"ControlNumber":"902534","Title":"My Samsung Galaxy Tab 4","Author":"Butow, Eric, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"0789753847","Description":"481 pages : color illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"880501727","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":126,"ControlNumber":"902594","Title":"Social security works! : why social security isn't going broke and how expanding it will help us all","Author":"Altman, Nancy J., 1950-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781620970379 (paperback)","Description":"299 pages : illustrations ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":9,"SystemItemsTotal":9,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"A growing chorus of prominent voices in Congress and elsewhere are calling for the expansion of our Social Security system-people who know that Social Security will not \"go broke\" and does not add a penny to the national debt. Social Security Works! will amplify these voices and offer a powerful antidote to the three-decade-long, billionaire-funded campaign to make us believe that this vital institution is destined to collapse. It isn't. From the Silent Generation to Baby Boomers, from Generation X to Millennials and Generation Z, we all have a stake in understanding the real story about Social Security. Critical to addressing the looming retirement crisis that will affect two- thirds of today's workers, Social Security is a powerful program that can help stop the collapse of the middle class, lessen the pressure squeezing families from all directions, and help end the upward redistribution of wealth that has resulted in perilous levels of inequality. All Americans deserve to have dignified retirement years as well as an umbrella to protect them and their families in the event of disability or premature death. Sure to be a game-changer, Social Security Works! cogently presents the issues and sets forth both an agenda and a political strategy that will benefit us all. At stake are our values and the kind of country we want for ourselves and for those that follow. \"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"873007795","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":127,"ControlNumber":"902703","Title":"As chimney sweepers come to dust : a Flavia de Luce novel","Author":"Bradley, C.

It suffers from the same kinds of crime, is subject to the same pressures from a rapidly changing world, and has the same hopes and fears as any number of towns up and down the land.   When Simon Serrailler is called in by Lafferton's new Chief Constable, Kieran Bright, he is met by two plainclothes officers, who ask him to take the principal role in a difficult, potentially dangerous undercover operation. He must leave town immediately, without telling anyone--not even his girlfriend Rachel, who has only just moved in with him.   Meanwhile, Simon's sister Cat is facing difficult choices at work, as Lafferton's hospice closes its bedded units--and at home, as her daughter is presented with a glittering opportunity that they would have to struggle to afford. And all is not well with Simon and Cat's stepmother, Judith, either.   To complete his special operation, Simon must inhabit the mind of the worst kind of criminal. This takes its toll on Simon and--as the investigation unfolds--also on the town and some of its most respected citizens.","OCLC":"861069027","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Hill, Susan, 1942- Simon Serrailler crime novels.","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Hill, Susan, 1942- Simon Serrailler crime novels.\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":129,"ControlNumber":"902846","Title":"Paul Simon : an American tune","Author":"Bonca, Cornel, 1958- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780810884816","Description":"xxxvi, 173 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"881498685","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Tempo (Lanham, Md.)","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Tempo (Lanham, Md.)\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":130,"ControlNumber":"902764","Title":"Peter Paul and Mary : fifty years in music and life","Author":"Peter, Paul, and Mary (Musical group), author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781936140329","Description":"144 pages : illustrations ; 28 x 31 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":4,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"This book visually tells us the intimate story of Peter, Paul, and Mary and their music, with stirring images that follow their passionate, fifty-year journey to the center of America's heart.

He also grew up believing this pioneering work might result in a memoir that would solve their financial woes. But when his father is killed in a shoot out with the police, he realizes there never was a memoir. All that's left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral and some maudlin what-ifs. Fuelled by this injustice and the general disrepair of his down-trodden hometown, he sets out to right another wrong: Dickens has literally been removed from the map to save California further embarrassment. Enlisting the help of the town's most famous resident--the last surviving Little Rascal, Hominy Jenkins, our narrator initiates a course of action--one that includes reinstating slavery and segregating the local high school--destined to bring national attention. These outrageous events land him with a law suit heard by the Supreme Court, the latest in a series of cases revolving around the thorny issue of race in America. The Sellout showcases a comic genius at the top of his game.

Whether they're cops or conmen, savage killers or creative types, gangsters or God-fearing citizens, George Pelecanos' characters are always engaged in a fight for their lives. They fight to advance or simply to survive; they fight against odds, against enemies, even against themselves. In this, his first collection of stories, the acclaimed novelist introduces readers to a vivid and eclectic cast of combatants. A seasoned claims investigator tracks a supposedly dead man from Miami to Brazil, only to be thrown off his game by a kid from the local slum. An aging loser takes a last stab at respectability by becoming a police informant. A Greek-American couple adopts an interracial trio of sons and then struggles to keep their family together, giving us a stirring bit of background on one of Pelecanos' most beloved protagonists, Spero Lucas. In the title novella - which takes its name from Hollywood slang for the last shot of the day, the one that comes before the liquor shots begin - we go behind the scenes of a television cop show, where a writer gets caught up in a drama more real than anything he could have conjured for a script. By turns heartbreaking and humane, brutal and funny, these finely constructed tales expose the violence and striving beneath the surface of any city and within any human heart. Tough, sexy, fast-paced, and crackling with energy, The Martini Shot is Pelecanos at his very best\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881318235","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":152,"ControlNumber":"904258","Title":"The like switch : an ex-FBI agent's guide to influencing, attracting, and winning people over","Author":"Schafer, Jack.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781476754482 (pbk.)","Description":"xv, 270 pages : illustrations ; 23 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":5,"SystemItemsTotal":6,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"873006490","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"A Touchstone book","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"A Touchstone book\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":153,"ControlNumber":"904268","Title":"Viking Bay : a Kay Hamilton novel","Author":"Lawson, M.

Iris Smythe-Smith is used to being underestimated. With her pale hair and quiet, sly wit she tends to blend into the background, and she likes it that way. So when Richard Kenworthy demands an introduction, she is suspicious. He flirts, he charms, he gives every impression of a man falling in love, but she can't quite believe it's all true.

They dictate whether something stands out, how we engage with it, whether we buy it, and how strongly we feel. This is especially true when it comes to design. And design is all around us, secretly shaping our world in ways we rarely recognise. Except if you yourself are a designer, like Chip Kidd. In Judge This, the reader travels through a day in the life of renowned designer Chip Kidd as he takes in first impressions of all kinds. We follow this visual journey with Kidd as he encounters and engages with everyday design, breaking down the good, the bad, the absurd and the brilliant as only a designer can. From the design of the paper you read in the morning to the subway ticket machine to the books you browse to the smartphone you use to the packaging for the chocolate bar you buy as an afternoon treat, Kidd will reveal the hidden secrets behind each of the design choices, with a healthy dose of humour, expertise and, of course, judgment as he goes\" -- from publisher's web site.","OCLC":"892074186","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":173,"ControlNumber":"905290","Title":"Eloquent Javascript : a modern introduction to programming","Author":"Haverbeke, Marijn.","Publisher":"San Francisco, CA : No Starch Press, 2015.","Edition":"2nd Edition","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781593275846","Description":"xiv, 451 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"","UPC":"689145758467","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":174,"ControlNumber":"905306","Title":"The PC and gadget help desk : in depth","Author":"Soper, Mark Edward, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780789753458","Description":"671 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"898013875","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":175,"ControlNumber":"905238","Title":"The handy Islam answer book","Author":"Renard, John.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781578595105 (paperback)","Description":"435 pages : illustrations ; 23 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"In an age of continued Middle East volatility, religious extremists, and terrorist threats, the mere mention of Islam and Muslims too often provokes misunderstanding and even rancor. Often overlooked are the important links between the Qur'an and the Bible. Also ignored are the significant historical overlap between Islamic interpretation of history with those of Christianity and Judaism, including the monotheistic belief in a single God. Islam is too often confusing and even opaque to those unfamiliar with it. The Handy Islam Answer Book, is clearly and eloquently written by John Renard, Ph.D., a scholar of Islam with more than 40 years of research and teaching experience. He provides detailed descriptions of the history, beliefs, symbols, rituals, observations, customs, leaders, and organization of the world's second largest religion. Renard explains the significance of the Five Pillars, Muhammad, various sects, the Qur'an, Islamic law, and much more. This engaging primer is a resource for reliable information about Islam and Muslims and it brings an understanding of the shared humanity that joins Muslims and non-Muslims far more deeply than cultural or religious differences separate them. Truly a must-have reference for our changing and trying times, this user-friendly guide answers nearly 800 questions and offers fun facts that cover Islamic history, religious practices, and Muslim cultural perspectives, including: When did Islam begin? Why is Mecca a holy city for Muslims? Do Muslims worship Muhammad? What was the fate of Medieval Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land? What do Muslims mean by the term \"Allah\"? What does the crescent moon and star symbol mean to Muslims? What is the Muslim \"call to prayer\"? Is it similar to \"church bells\"? Do Muslims believe that God \"tests\" people? Does Muhammad play a role in Islamic spirituality in a manner similar to Jesus' role in Christianity? Is jihad a legal concept for Muslims? Is it true that Muhammad both preached and engaged in military campaigns? Do Muslims, Christians, and Jews worship the \"same God\"? Why do Jews, Christians, and Muslims all claim parts of Israel\/Palestine as \"Holy Land\"? Why do some people, such as the Taliban, not want girls to get an education? Does Islam require wearing face veils? Does Islam have theologians like Augustine and Thomas Aquinas and the other great Christian thinkers? Is there any similarity between Muslim and Christian art? Muslims are diverse, and they have a vast spectrum of views about Islam. The Handy Islam Answer Book aims for understanding, which is the first step to uniting, instead of dividing. This helpful books provides a historic timeline, a glossary of commonly used terms, a genealogy from Adam to Muhammad and beyond, a calendar of major observances, and a bibliography help further exploration of one of the world's great religions\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"880566392","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":176,"ControlNumber":"905487","Title":"The book of the sultan's seal : strange incidents from history in the city of Mars","Author":"Rakhā, Yūsuf., author","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781566569910","Description":"374 pages ; 21 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"882191005","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Interlink world fiction.","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Interlink world fiction.\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":177,"ControlNumber":"905488","Title":"Steadfast heart","Author":"Peterson, Tracie.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780764213014 (hardcover : alk. paper)","Description":"329 pages ; 23 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"MCN FICTION PET","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":4,"SystemItemsTotal":5,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"In 1880s Seattle, Washington, Lenore Fulcher desires love while so many around her are finding it; when lawyer Kolbein Booth arrives searching for his sister at a finishing school for mail-order brides, he and Lenore face danger and uncertainty amidst their growing attraction\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"889945315","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Peterson, Tracie.

Elena Kelly is a body broker or \"corpse wrangler,\" one of the best in her field. When she became too ambitious, cut too many corners and too many ethical (and legal) safeguards, she ran afoul of the law and medical profession, triggering a huge scandal in Louisville, Kentucky that quickly went national. She lost everything - and now humbled and on a strict, three-year parole, she works as coroner's assistant in Danville. Elena is still trying to come to grips with her regret and guilt when she is unexpectedly drawn into the search for her former best friend's missing body. Elena knows what can happen to a body that goes 'missing', how it can be salvaged and used indiscriminately for spare parts, and she endeavors to seek salvation in finding Lia and bringing her body home, as complete as possible. Her desperate search drags her back to the underworld of the dead and pits her against a new and nefarious corpse wrangler - one more talented and deadly than she ever was. Second Life pulls back the curtain on those who exist on the edge of the medical profession, the ones who remove skin and tissue and bones from the dead, for use by surgeons, medical students practicing technique, cosmetic surgeons, medical equipment companies and labs running medical experiments-anyone in need of muscle and ligament and bones. It philosophically explores our obligation to protect the dead and thrillingly examines what happens when we -literally- leave the land of the living. \"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881666062","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":192,"ControlNumber":"905845","Title":"The Norton anthology of world religions","Author":"","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780393062533","Description":"2 volumes : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":4,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"869770893","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":193,"ControlNumber":"905869","Title":"Steampunk LEGO : the illustrated researches of various fantastical devices by Sir Herbert Jobson, with epistles to the Crown, Her Majesty Queen Victoria : a travelogue in 11 chapters","Author":"Himber, Guy, 1965- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781593275280","Description":"189 pages : color illustrations, maps, portraits ; 27 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Filled with LEGO-based airships and dirigibles, monowheels and penny-farthings, cabinets of curiosity and robots galore, Steampunk LEGO is an illustrated gallery of Victorian-era treasures, all built from LEGO.

Only Reggie Love's, however, went through the White House by way of Duke University's Cameron Indoor Stadium. Mentored by both Coach Krzyzewski and President Obama, Love shares universal insights learned in unique circumstances, an education in how sports, politics, and life can define who you are, what you believe in, and what it takes to make a difference. Power Forward tells the story of the five years Love worked as a personal assistant to Senator Obama as a candidate for president, and President Obama, and it is a professional coming of age story like no other. What the public knows was well put by Time magazine in 2008: \"[Love's] official duties don't come close to capturing Reggie's close bond with Obama, who plays a role that is part boss and part big brother.\" What the public doesn't know are the innumerable private moments during which that bond was forged and the President mentored a malleable young man. Accountability and serving with pride and honor were learned during unsought moments: from co-coaching grade school girls basketball with the president; lending Obama his tie ahead of a presidential debate; managing a personal life when no hour is truly his own; being tasked with getting the candidate up in the morning on time for long days of campaigning. From his first interview with Senator Obama, to his near-decision not to follow the president-elect to the White House, to eventually bringing LeBron, Melo, D-Wade, and Kobe to play with the President on his forty-ninth birthday, Love drew on Coach K's teachings as he learned to navigate Washington. But it was while owning up to losing (briefly) the President's briefcase, figuring out how to compete effectively in pick-up games in New Hampshire during the primary to secure support and votes, babysitting the children of visiting heads of state, and keeping the President company at every major turning point of his historic first campaign and administration, that Love learned how persistence and passion can lead not only to success, but to a broader concept of responsibility\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"883146718","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":206,"ControlNumber":"906216","Title":"Secrets of a scandalous heiress","Author":"Romain, Theresa, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781402284052 (paperback)","Description":"316 pages ; 18 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Heiress Augusta Meredith can't help herself-she stirs up gossip wherever she goes.

Without false pride or bitterness, Tunstall recounts the hijinks of training to be a pilot, terrifying bombing raids, and elaborate escape attempts at once hilarious and deadly serious--all part of a poignant and human war story superbly told by a natural raconteur. \"The Last Escaper \"is a captivating final testament by the \"last man standing\" from the Greatest Generation.\"--Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881093954","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":214,"ControlNumber":"906327","Title":"The Christmas bouquet [large print] : a Chesapeake Shores novel","Author":"Woods, Sherryl.","Publisher":"","Edition":"Center Point Large Print edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781628994049 (library binding : alk. paper)","Description":"294 pages (large print) ; 23 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"2701","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":27,"CallNumber":"LTFIC WOO","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":4,"SystemItemsTotal":5,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Catching a bridal bouquet and an unexpected pregnancy threatens medical student Caitlyn Winters's plans for the future.

Virtually everything in our lives is digital, numerical, or quantified. The story of how and where we got these numerals, which we so depend on, has for thousands of years been shrouded in mystery. Finding Zero is an adventure filled saga of Amir Aczel's lifelong obsession: to find the original sources of our numerals. Aczel has doggedly crisscrossed the ancient world, scouring dusty, moldy texts, cross examining so-called scholars who offered wildly differing sets of facts, and ultimately penetrating deep into a Cambodian jungle to find a definitive proof. Here, he takes the reader along for the ride. The history begins with the early Babylonian cuneiform numbers, followed by the later Greek and Roman letter numerals. Then Aczel asks the key question: where do the numbers we use today, the so-called Hindu-Arabic numerals, come from? It is this search that leads him to explore uncharted territory, to go on a grand quest into India, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and ultimately into the wilds of Cambodia. There he is blown away to find the earliest zero--the keystone of our entire system of numbers--on a crumbling, vine-covered wall of a seventh-century temple adorned with eaten-away erotic sculptures. While on this odyssey, Aczel meets a host of fascinating characters: academics in search of truth, jungle trekkers looking for adventure, surprisingly honest politicians, shameless smugglers, and treacherous archaeological thieves--who finally reveal where our numbers come from. \"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881041966","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":227,"ControlNumber":"906428","Title":"The body snatchers affair : a Carpenter and Quincannon mystery","Author":"Muller, Marcia, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"0765331764","Description":"219 pages ; 22 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"FICTION MUL","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":20,"SystemItemsTotal":20,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Conducting a dual investigation in the opium dens of Chinatown, Sabina Carpenter and John Quincannon search for missing millionaires against a backdrop of a brewing Tong war.","OCLC":"879527296","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Muller, Marcia.

As Zelizer shows, this view is off-base: in many respects America was even more conservative than it seems now, and Johnson's legislative program faced bitter resistance\" --Amazon.com.","OCLC":"881094066","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":235,"ControlNumber":"906467","Title":"A parent's guide to high-functioning autism spectrum disorder : how to meet the challenges and help your child thrive","Author":"Ozonoff, Sally.","Publisher":"","Edition":"Second edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781462517473","Description":"xi, 308 pages ; 23 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Packed with real-life stories and everyday problem-solving ideas, this book has given many tens of thousands of parents the facts they need about high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including Asperger syndrome.

Along with aerobic exercise and flexibility, body weight training is an integral part of a complete physical activity program. But with all the different equipment and techniques available, getting started can feel overwhelming. Want to get pumped about weight training? Consider these facts: strength training, whether via free weights or a machine, builds muscle. And the more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism and the less prone you are to injuries--in and out of the gym. Plus, strength training promotes bone strength, which can significantly reduce your odds of developing osteoporosis. If that's not enough, strength training--unlike cardio workouts like running--reaps benefits almost immediately. So what are you waiting for?

Even the presence of Lieutenant Cartledge won't keep Monk and Natalie from attending the funeral of Judge Oberlin, and it's a good thing.

Pulling together the food, flowers and a thousand other details for one of the most significant social occasions of the year is her happily accepted responsibility. But when her husband's degenerate nephew is found murdered, it's more than the ball that is ruined. In fact, Lady Montfort fears that the official police enquiry, driven by petty snobbery and class prejudice, is pointing towards her son as a potential suspect. Taking matters into her own hands, the rather over-imaginative countess enlists the help of her pragmatic housekeeper, Mrs. Jackson, to investigate the case, track down the women that vanished the night of the murder, and clear her son's name. As the two women search for a runaway housemaid and a headstrong young woman, they unearth the hidden lives of Lady Montfort's close friends, servants and family and discover the identity of a murderer hiding in plain sight. In this enchanting debut sure to appeal to fans of Downton Abbey, Tessa Arlen draws readers into a world exclusively enjoyed by the rich, privileged classes and suffered by the men and women who serve them. Death of a Dishonorable Gentleman is an elegant mystery filled with intriguing characters and fascinating descriptions of Edwardian life--a superb treat for those who love British novels\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881041978","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":247,"ControlNumber":"906618","Title":"How to think about exercise","Author":"Young, Damon, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First U.S. edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"1250059046 (pbk.)","Description":"246 pages : illustrations ; 18 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"876349567","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"School of life.","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"School of life.\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":248,"ControlNumber":"906621","Title":"A thing of beauty","Author":"Samson, Lisa, 1964-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781595545473 (softcover)","Description":"295 pages ;","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"It's a wonder to behold what happens when love moves in.

She retreated to Baltimore and bought an old mansion downtown with dreams of restoring it into a masterpiece--maybe creating an artist's studio for herself. And living an artist's life. That was the plan. Ten years later, Fiona's huge house is filled with junk purchased at thrift stores, yard sales, or picked up from the side of the road. Each piece was destined for a project, but all she's got so far is a piece of twine with some antique buttons threaded down its length. Her money has almost run out. She will soon lose her house and will be forced back into acting. So it is that Fiona comes to rent out a room to a local blacksmith, Josiah. Little by little, Josiah magically transforms Fiona's home into something beautiful. She comes to life again.

Ricky Torres, his old friend from his days as a cop, needs Ray's help, and he needs it right now in the middle of the night. Ricky picks Ray up in the taxi he has been driving since returning from serving as a Marine in Iraq, but before Ricky can tell Ray what's going on the windows of the taxi explode under a hail of bullets killing Ricky and knocking Ray unconscious as he dives to pull Ricky out of harm's way. Ray would've done anything to help Ricky out while he was alive. Now that he's dead, he'll go to the same lengths to find out who did it and why. All he has to go on is that Ricky was working with Jack Knight, another ex-cop turned PI.

There are many positive ways in which the Internet has contributed to the world, but as a society we are less aware of the Internet's deeply negative effects. In 2007, Andrew Keen, a longtime Silicon Valley-based observer of the digital world and a serial Internet entrepreneur, published one of the first Internet-sceptic books, The Cult of the Amateur, which asked how quality content can be created in an online environment that demands everything for free. In Keen's new book, The Internet Is Not the Answer, he offers a comprehensive look at what the Internet is doing to our lives. The book traces the technological and economic history of the Internet, from its founding in the 1960s to the creation of the World Wide Web in 1989, through the waves of start-ups and the rise of the big data companies to the increasing attempts to monetize almost every human activity. Successful Internet companies have produced astronomical returns on investment, and venture capital and the profit motive have become the primary drivers of innovation. In this sharp, witty narrative, informed by the work of other writers, reporters, and recent academic studies as well as his own research and interviews, Keen shows us the tech world, warts and all--from hoodie-wearing misfit millionaires, to the NSA's all-encompassing online surveillance, to the impact of the Internet on unemployment and economic inequality. The Internet Is Not the Answer is a big-picture look at what the Internet is doing to our society and an investigation into what we can do to try to make sure that the decisions we are making about the reconfiguring of our world do not lead to unpleasant, unforeseen aftershocks\" -- from publisher's web site.","OCLC":"892076184","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":260,"ControlNumber":"906583","Title":"Accounting handbook","Author":"Siegel, Joel G., author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"Sixth edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780764166570","Description":"1062 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"881386495","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":261,"ControlNumber":"906592","Title":"The cause of all nations : an international history of the American Civil War","Author":"Doyle, Don Harrison, 1946-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780465029679","Description":"xviii, 382 pages : illustrations, facsimiles, portraits ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":6,"SystemItemsTotal":6,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"When Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address in 1863, he had broader aims than simply rallying a war-weary nation. Lincoln realized that the Civil War had taken on a wider significance-that all of Europe and Latin America was watching to see whether the United States, a beleaguered model of democracy, would indeed 'perish from the earth.' In The Cause of All Nations, distinguished historian Don H. Doyle explains that the Civil War was viewed abroad as part of a much larger struggle for democracy that spanned the Atlantic Ocean, and had begun with the American and French Revolutions. While battles raged at Bull Run, Antietam, and Gettysburg, a parallel contest took place abroad, both in the marbled courts of power and in the public square. Foreign observers held widely divergent views on the war-from radicals such as Karl Marx and Giuseppe Garibaldi who called on the North to fight for liberty and equality, to aristocratic monarchists, who hoped that the collapse of the Union would strike a death blow against democratic movements on both sides of the Atlantic. Nowhere were these monarchist dreams more ominous than in Mexico, where Napoleon III sought to implement his Grand Design for a Latin Catholic empire that would thwart the spread of Anglo-Saxon democracy and use the Confederacy as a buffer state. Hoping to capitalize on public sympathies abroad, both the Union and the Confederacy sent diplomats and special agents overseas: the South to seek recognition and support, and the North to keep European powers from interfering. Confederate agents appealed to those conservative elements who wanted the South to serve as a bulwark against radical egalitarianism. Lincoln and his Union agents overseas learned to appeal to many foreigners by embracing emancipation and casting the Union as the embattled defender of universal republican ideals, the \"last best hope of earth.\" A bold account of the international dimensions of America's defining conflict, The Cause of All Nations frames the Civil War as a pivotal moment in a global struggle that would decide the survival of democracy.\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"897346079","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":262,"ControlNumber":"906594","Title":"Work simply : embracing the power of your personal productivity style","Author":"Tate, Carson.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781591847304","Description":"xi, 286 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Make work simple by using the tools and tactics that are right for you Your time is under attack. You just can't get enough done. You find yourself wondering where the hours go. You've tried every time-management system you can get your hands on-and they've only succeeded in making your work more complicated. Sound familiar? If you sometimes feel you spend more time managing your productivity than doing actual work, it's time for a change. In Work Simply, renowned productivity expert Carson Tate offers a step-by-step guide to making work simple again by using the style that works best for you. Tate has helped thousands of men and women better manage their time and become more productive. Her success owes partly to the realization that most of us fit into one of four distinct productivity styles: Arrangers, who think about their projects in terms of the people involved; Prioritizers, who are the definition of \"goal-oriented\"; Visualizers, who possess a unique ability to comprehend the big picture; and Planners, who live for the details. In this book, you'll learn How to identify your own productivity style as well as the styles of those around you-bosses, coworkers, staff, and family. How to select your \"tools of the trade\" to maximize your effectiveness, from the style of pen you use to the way you decorate your office. When face-to-face conversations are more effective than e-mails-and vice versa. What it takes to lead the perfect meeting.

Basem, an apolitical middle-class architect, jeopardized the lives of his family when he seized the chance to improve his country. Moaz, a contrarian Muslim Brother, defied his own organization to join the opposition. These revolutionaries had little more than their idealism with which to battle the secret police, the old oligarchs, and a power-hungry military determined to keep control. Basem was determined to change the system from within and became one of the only revolutionaries to win a seat in parliament. Moaz took a different course, convinced that only street pressure from youth movements could dismantle the old order. Thanassis Cambanis tells the story of the noble dreamers who brought Egypt to the brink of freedom, and the dark powerful forces that--for the time being--stopped them short.

The student Simmea, born an Egyptian farmer's daughter sometime between 500 and 1000 A.D, is a brilliant child, eager for knowledge,  ready to strive to be her best self. The teacher Maia was once Ethel, a young Victorian lady of much learning and few prospects, who prayed to Pallas Athene in an unguarded moment during a trip to Rome - and, in an instant, found herself in the Just City with grey-eyed Athene standing unmistakably before her. Meanwhile, Apollo - stunned by the realization that there are things mortals understand better than he does - has arranged to live a human life, and has come to the City as one of the children.

The people she encounters speak, volubly, about themselves: their fantasies, anxieties, pet theories, regrets, and longings.

He's soon distracted, though, by the difficulties of being the new, shy kid at school, and he befriends the other two kids who seem to be outcasts: overweight Tommie and too-smart-for-her-own-good Anna-Marie. Together they try to weather the storm of bullying teachers and fellow students, by escaping into explorations of the seemingly bucolic countryside. There, though, they find other outcasts from society such as cranky Mr. Merridew, who won't leave his cottage in the woods, and Scarecrow Man, who stands in the fields searching the skies. And meanwhile, Peter is disturbed by the growing awareness that his own mother may be some sort of outcast, too--and that she's hiding something from him in a locked room in the attic, a room she's expressly forbidden him from entering. Written in beautiful prose, Everlasting Lane is a captivating, absorbing, and suspenseful evocation of the spells of childhood: sun-soaked, nostalgic, with the soft focus and warm glow of a Polaroid--but it's darker than it seems.

Rolling Stone ranked the Ramones at #26 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\" They received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011 and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. And Marky Ramone played a major part in this success--his \"blitzkrieg\" style of drumming drove the sound the Ramones pioneered. Now, fans can get the inside story. Before he joined the Ramones, Marc Bell was already a name in the New York music scene. But when he joined three other tough misfits, he became Marky Ramone, and the rhythm that came to epitomize punk was born. Having outlived his bandmates, Marky is the only person who can share the secrets and stories of the Ramones' improbable rise from obtuse beginnings to induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But it wasn't all good times and hit songs, and Marky doesn't shy away from discussing his own struggles, including the addiction to alcohol that led him to be temporarily kicked out of the band. From the cult film Rock 'n' Roll High School through \"I Wanna Be Sedated\" through his own struggle with alcoholism, Marky Ramone sets the record straight, painting an unflinching picture of the dysfunction behind the band that changed a generation. With exclusive behind-the-scenes photos, Punk Rock Blitzkrieg is both a cultural history of punk and a stirring story that millions of fans have been waiting for\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"880689837","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":306,"ControlNumber":"907400","Title":"Driven to distraction at work : how to focus and be more productive","Author":"Hallowell, Edward M., author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781422186411","Description":"viii, 247 pages : illustrations ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"158.7 HAL","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":10,"SystemItemsTotal":13,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Hallowell, known for his work with children and adults, now identifies the underlying reasons why people really lose their ability to focus at work--where many of today's adults feel distracted and unproductive.

Learn to step off and hit your stride. Not long ago Christine Carter, happiness expert at UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, speaker, writer, and mother, found herself caught up in the busyness of modern life: too many conflicting obligations and not enough time, energy, or patience to get everything done. She tried all the standard techniques--prioritizing, multitasking, delegating--but found that she needed a new approach, one that would allow her to live more in that zone we've all glimpsed but can never seem to hold on to: the sweet spot of expertise, efficiency, and ease. Drawing on her vast knowledge of the latest psychological, neurological, and biological science related to happiness, productivity, and elite performance, Carter put herself through the practical paces. Her goal was not to live a stress-free life, but rather to build stress resilience and find a quicker path to calm and confidence. Her trials and errors are our reward. In The Sweet Spot, Carter shares what she calls \"the sweet spot equation,\" a combination of strategies and practices for attaining happiness without giving up success, and for achieving success without compromising happiness. Using a simple formula, The Sweet Spot shows us how to take a brief recess, an inoculation against \"The Overwhelm\" and the key to converting stress into productive and creative energy institute daily micro-habits that free you up to focus on and enjoy more important things unplug from seemingly time-saving gadgets that can sap our strength, and use technology more strategically prioritize our relationships, making use of the hard science that points out how healthy connections help us thrive. cultivate tolerance for a little discomfort while we build mastery (the skills that make hard things feel easy) and develop the grit to bounce back from life's inevitable setbacks Complete with practical \"easiest thing\" tips for instant relief as well as stories from Carter's own experience of putting The Sweet Spot into action, this timely and inspiring book lets us in on the possibilities for joy and freedom that comes when we stop trying to do everything right--and start doing the right things\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"891718656","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":313,"ControlNumber":"907492","Title":"Twitter for dummies","Author":"Fitton, Laura, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"3rd edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781118954836","Description":"xiv, 294 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Provides information on using the social networking site, covering such topics as accessing the Twitter interface, searching for people with similar interests, replying to others' tweets, and using Twitter to promote a business or cause.","OCLC":"878023861","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"--For dummies.","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"--For dummies.\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":314,"ControlNumber":"907602","Title":"Lost & found","Author":"Davis, Brooke.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"0525954686","Description":"310 pages ; 22 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":10,"SystemItemsTotal":13,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Follows a shared encounter between an abandoned 7-year-old, a widowed shut-in and a nursing home escapee, who embark on a road trip across Western Australia to find the child's mother.","OCLC":"881093466","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":315,"ControlNumber":"907604","Title":"Secrets of ancient America : archaeoastronomy and the legacy of the Phoenicians, Celts, and other forgotten explorers","Author":"Lehrburger, Carl, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781591431930","Description":"xii, 433 pages, 32 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some color), maps ; 25 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"The real history of the New World and the visitors, from both East and West, who traveled to the Americas long before 1492.

As the myth of Columbus 'discovering' America falls from the pedestal of established history, we are given the opportunity to discover the real story of the New World and the visitors, from both East and West, who traveled there long before 1492. Sharing his more than 25 years of research and travel to sites throughout North America, Carl Lehrburger employs epigraphy, archaeology, and archaeoastronomy to reveal extensive evidence for pre-Columbian explorers in ancient America. He provides more than 300 photographs and drawings of sites, relics, and rock art, including Celtic and Norse runes in New England, Phoenician and Hebrew inscriptions in the Midwest, and ancient Shiva linga and Egyptian hieroglyphs in the West. He uncovers the real story of Columbus and his motives for coming to the Americas. He reinterprets many well-known archaeological and astronomical finds, such as the Ohio Serpent Mound, America's Stonehenge in New Hampshire, and the Crespi Collection in Ecuador. He reveals Celtic, Hebrew, Roman, early Christian, Templar, Egyptian, Chinese, and Japanese influences in famous stones and ruins, reconstructing the record of what really happened on the American continents prior to Columbus. He also looks at Hindu influences in Mesoamerica and sacred sexuality encoded in archaeological sites. Expanding upon the work of well-known diffusionists such as Barry Fell and Gunnar Thompson, the author documents the travels and settlements of trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific explorers, miners, and settlers who made it to the Americas and left their marks for us to discover.

Richard Davis tells the story of this venerable and enduring book, from its origins in ancient India to its reception today as a spiritual classic that has been translated into more than seventy-five languages. The Gita opens on the eve of a mighty battle, when the warrior Arjuna is overwhelmed by despair and refuses to fight. He turns to his charioteer, Krishna, who counsels him on why he must. In the dialogue that follows, Arjuna comes to realize that the true battle is for his own soul.Davis highlights the place of this legendary dialogue in classical Indian culture, and then examines how it has lived on in diverse settings and contexts. He looks at the medieval devotional traditions surrounding the divine character of Krishna and traces how the Gita traveled from India to the West, where it found admirers in such figures as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Aldous Huxley. Davis explores how Indian nationalists like Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda used the Gita in their fight against colonial rule, and how contemporary interpreters reanimate and perform this classical work for audiences today.An essential biography of a timeless masterpiece, this book is an ideal introduction to the Gita and its insights into the struggle for self-mastery that we all must wage\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"894467113","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Lives of great religious books.","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Lives of great religious books.\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":319,"ControlNumber":"907676","Title":"The business of naming things","Author":"Coffey, Michael, 1954-","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781934137864 (paperback)","Description":"207 pages ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":4,"SystemItemsTotal":5,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"\"Riveting. vibrant and unsparing.\" -Publishers Weekly (starred and boxed review) \"Once I started reading these stories, I couldn't stop.

In 2012, the Nobel committee confirmed Mo Yan's position as one of the greatest and most important writers of our time. In his much-anticipated new novel, Mo Yan chronicles the sweeping history of modern China through the lens of the nation's controversial one- child policy. Frog opens with a playwright nicknamed Tadpole who plans to write about his aunt. In her youth, Gugu-the beautiful daughter of a famous doctor and staunch Communist-is revered for her skill as a midwife. But when her lover defects, Gugu's own loyalty to the Party is questioned. She decides to prove her allegiance by strictly enforcing the one-child policy, keeping tabs on the number of children in the village, and performing abortions on women as many as eight months pregnant. In sharply personal prose, Mo Yan depicts a world of desperate families, illegal surrogates, forced abortions, and the guilt of those who must enforce the policy. At once illuminating and devastating, it shines a light into the heart of communist China. \"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881093464","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":324,"ControlNumber":"907685","Title":"Wildalone","Author":"Zourkova, Krassi, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780062328021 : HRD","Description":"374 pages : map ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":8,"SystemItemsTotal":8,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"A Princeton freshman is drawn into a love triangle with two enigmatic brothers and discovers terrifying secrets about her family and herself\"--Book jacket.","OCLC":"877912386","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":325,"ControlNumber":"907687","Title":"Etta and Otto and Russell and James","Author":"Hooper, Emma.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Simon & Schuster hardcover edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781476755670 (hardcover)","Description":"305 pages ; 22 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":20,"SystemItemsTotal":22,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"899738636","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":326,"ControlNumber":"907688","Title":"Descent : a novel","Author":"Johnston, Tim, 1962-","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781616203047","Description":"374 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":26,"SystemItemsTotal":28,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"A girl vanishes \"on a sunny, late-summer vacation morning\" and thus begins a \"family's harrowing journey down increasingly divergent and solitary paths, until all that continues to bind them to each other are the questions they can never bring themselves to ask: At what point does a family stop searching?

But it's a bit less widely understood that in about 1950, this stream of great songs more or less dried up. All of a sudden, what came over the radio wasn't Gershwin, Porter, and Berlin, but \"Come on-a My House\" and \"How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?\" Elvis and rock and roll arrived a few years later, and at that point the game was truly up. What happened, and why? In The B Side, acclaimed cultural historian Ben Yagoda answers those questions in a fascinating piece of detective work. Drawing on previously untapped archival sources and on scores of interviews--the voices include Randy Newman, Jimmy Webb, Linda Ronstadt, and Herb Alpert--the book illuminates broad musical trends through a series of intertwined stories. Among them are the battle between ASCAP and Broadcast Music, Inc.; the revolution in jazz after World War II; the impact of radio and then television; and the bitter, decades-long feud between Mitch Miller and Frank Sinatra. The B Side is about taste, and the particular economics and culture of songwriting, and the potential of popular art for greatness and beauty. It's destined to become a classic of American musical history\" -- from publisher's web site.","OCLC":"881094034","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":329,"ControlNumber":"907656","Title":"The everything parent's guide to Common Core math: grades 6-8 : understand the new math standards to help your child learn and succeed","Author":"Sirois, Jamie L.","Publisher":"Avon, Mass. : Adams Media, c2015.","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781440583575 (pbk.)","Description":"336 p. : ill. ; 24 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"883647384","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Everything series.","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Everything series.\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":330,"ControlNumber":"907691","Title":"The unquiet dead","Author":"Khan, Ausma Zehanat, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781250055118 (hbk.)","Description":"344 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"http:\/\/www.netread.com\/jcusers2\/bk1388\/118\/9781250055118\/image\/lgcover.9781250055118.jpg","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":11,"SystemItemsTotal":13,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Detective Esa Khattak is in the midst of his evening prayers when he receives a phone call asking that he and ...

Post-war Boston is down on its luck and looking for change. A year after the Brink's Robbery--the largest robbery in the history of the United States--Boston is known more for its seedy underbelly than for its rich, historical past. The winter of 1951 is the worst in recent memory, and the Bruins are suffering another losing season. Like the city itself, lifelong residents Cal O'Brien and Dante Cooper are struggling to find their identities after World War II. Cal has built a mildly promising life for himself as an employee of a company providing private security, whether to an honorable businessman who needs a nightwatchman or to an Irish mafioso who needs to have someone's legs broken. Dante is everything Cal is not. A heroin addict trying and failing to stay clean, Dante feels the call to do good after he discovers that his sister-in-law was the latest victim of a serial killer targeting disadvantaged women. Woefully unqualified, but determined to help, Cal and Dante take it upon themselves to track the killer--but their daunting quest takes on dangerous consequences when the trail leads them to the highest ranks of city government. There are a few well-placed men who don't want Cal and Dante to solve this case.

She is haunted by a baby boy she met when she was six, who sometimes recurs as other people's babies. Cheryl is also obsessed with Phillip, a philandering board member at the women's self-defense nonprofit where she works. She believes they've been making love for many lifetimes, though they have yet to consummate in this one. When Cheryl's bosses ask if their twenty-one-year-old daughter, Clee, can move into her house for a little while, Cheryl's eccentrically ordered world explodes.

It's easy to walk away from lies. Power is another thing. MacKayla Lane would do anything to save the home she loves. A gifted sidhe-seer, she's already fought and defeated the deadly Sinsar Dubh--an ancient book of terrible evil--yet its hold on her has never been stronger. When the wall that protected humans from the seductive, insatiable Fae was destroyed on Halloween, long-imprisoned immortals ravaged the planet. Now Dublin is a war zone with factions battling for control. As the city heats up and the ice left by the Hoar Frost King melts, tempers flare, passions run red-hot, and dangerous lines get crossed. Seelie and Unseelie vie for power against nine ancient immortals who have governed Dublin for millennia; a rival band of sidhe-seers invades the city, determined to claim it for their own; Mac's former protege and best friend, Dani \"Mega\" O'Malley, is now her fierce enemy; and even more urgent, Highland druid Christian MacKeltar has been captured by the Crimson Hag and is being driven deeper into Unseelie madness with each passing day. The only one Mac can depend on is the powerful, dangerous immortal Jericho Barrons, but even their fiery bond is tested by betrayal. It's a world where staying alive is a constant struggle, the line between good and evil is blurred, and every alliance comes at a price.

It is pictured as big as billboards and as small as postage stamps, evoked in political campaigns and car advertising campaigns, relived in museums and revised in computer games. As the nation's founding moment, the American Revolution serves as a source of powerful founding myths, and remains the most accessible and most contested event in U.S. history: more than any other, it stands as a proxy for how Americans perceive the nation's aspirations. Americans' increased fascination with the Revolution over the past two decades represents more than interest in the past. It's also a site to work out the present, and the future. What are we using the Revolution to debate? In Fighting over the Founders, Andrew M. Schocket explores how politicians, screenwriters, activists, biographers, jurists, museum professionals, and reenactors portray the American Revolution. Identifying competing 'essentialist' and 'organicist' interpretations of the American Revolution, Schocket shows how today's memories of the American Revolution reveal American's conflicted ideas about class, about race, and about gender--as well as the nature of history itself. Fighting over the Founders plumbs our views of the past and the present, and illuminates our ideas of what United States means to its citizens in the new millennium\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"876883327","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":346,"ControlNumber":"907698","Title":"Puzzled indemnity : a Puzzle Lady mystery","Author":"Hall, Parnell.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781250027177","Description":"262 pages : illustrations; 22 cm","WebLink":"http:\/\/www.netread.com\/jcusers2\/bk1388\/177\/9781250027177\/image\/lgcover.9781250027177.jpg","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"FICTION HAL","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":12,"SystemItemsTotal":13,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"It's been a cold, lonely winter for Cora Felton.

Today, unemployment hovers at a near-record high, yet 3.5 million American jobs remain unfilled. Why? Because companies simply cannot find people with the skills they actually need. The good news is that this skills gap represents unprecedented opportunities for every person seeking a successful and exciting career. But these opportunities can't be found inside the walls of the traditional classroom. Instead, they lie in the myriad of educational options that provide the technical, vocational, and soft skills on demand in today's workplace, such as: -Professional certifications: Start your career faster in fields like bioscience aviation, culinary arts, and medical technology. -Associates degrees: Increase earning potential through inexpensive 2-year programs in subjects like civil engineering, environmental science, education, and nursing. -Apprenticeships: Earn while you learn under the direct supervision of a skilled expert. Far beyond the artisan trades, today's apprenticeships can be found at companies like Volkswagen and Siemens. -Occupational learning: Refresh or reboot your skill sets through on-the-job training or online education. In Job U, you'll learn about these paths to rewarding occupations; where to find them and how to parlay them into the best paying job in any field. And along the way, you'll meet individuals of all ages who have attained their \"dream jobs\" through a non-traditional education: from an emergency air paramedic, to a lead mechanic of a racecar team, to an engineer of complex gas turbine generators, to a bestselling cookbook author. Whether you are recent high school or college graduate, or well along in your career journey, Job U will help you find your way to a more secure and prosperous future\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"896126629","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":354,"ControlNumber":"907852","Title":"Ecuador : the essential guide to customs & culture","Author":"Maddicks, Russell, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781857336832","Description":"168 pages : illustrations ; 18 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"871329453","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Culture smart!","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Culture smart!\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":355,"ControlNumber":"907917","Title":"Viper game","Author":"Feehan, Christine, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"Jove mass-market edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780515155549","Description":"433 pages : illustrations ; 18 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"MCN FICTION FEE","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":5,"SystemItemsTotal":6,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"GhostWalker Wyatt Fontenot, the subject of a secret military experiment that gave him special catlike abilities, returns home to the bayou and helps the mysterious Le Poivre de Cayenne protect three girls from a deadly enemy.","OCLC":"883367253","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Feehan, Christine.

George Friedman has forecasted the coming trends (politics, technology, population, and culture) of the next century in The Next 100 Years, and focused his predictions on the coming ten years in The Next Decade. Now, in Flashpoints, Friedman zooms in on the region that has, for five hundred years, been the cultural hotbed of the world--Europe--and examines the most basic and fascinating building block of the region: culture. Analyzing the fault lines that have existed for centuries--and which have led to two world wars and dozens more conflicts--Friedman walks us through the 'flashpoints' that are still smoldering beneath the surface and are on course to erupt again. In Flashpoints, George Friedman begins with a fascinating history of the events leading up to the horrific wars that nearly tore apart Western civilization--killing over 100 million people on the 'civilized' European continent. Modern-day Europe, and the formation of the European Union, were designed to minimize the built-in geopolitical tensions that led to catastrophic war, but as Friedman shows with a mix of history and cultural analysis, those plans have failed. 'Flashpoints' are now simmering as dangerously as in the early twentieth century. Zeroing in on half a dozen locations, borderlands, and cultural dynamics, George Friedman does what few historians can--he explains precisely how certain trends are unstoppable, and what the future holds, both in terms of conflict and also opportunity. Flashpoints also explains in riveting detail how events in Europe will affect the rest of the world--from the United States to Russia, from China to Latin America. Continuing in his bestselling tradition, he reveals a geopolitical landscape that is at once a scintillating history lesson and a forecast for the coming years\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"894777581","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":362,"ControlNumber":"908063","Title":"The girl from Human Street : ghosts of memory in a Jewish family","Author":"Cohen, Roger, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780307594662 (hbk.)","Description":"304 pages : illustrations, genealogical table ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":7,"SystemItemsTotal":7,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Award-winning New York Times columnist Roger Cohen turns a compassionate yet discerning eye on the legacy of his own forebears. As he follows them across continents and decades, mapping individual lives that diverge and intertwine, vital patterns of struggle and resilience, valued heritage and evolving loyalties (religious, ethnic, national), converge into a resonant portrait of cultural identity in the modern age. Beginning in the nineteenth century and continuing through to the present day, Cohen tracks his family's story of repeated upheaval, from Lithuania to South Africa, and then to England, the United States, and Israel. It is a tale of otherness marked by overt and latent anti-Semitism, but also otherness as a sense of inheritance. We see Cohen's family members grow roots in each adopted homeland even as they struggle to overcome the loss of what is left behind and to adapt. At the heart of The Girl from Human Street is the powerful and touching relationship between Cohen and his mother, that \"girl.\" Tortured by the upheavals in her life yet stoic in her struggle, she embodies her son's complex inheritance.--From publisher description.","OCLC":"881279996","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":363,"ControlNumber":"908141","Title":"Leaving before the rains come","Author":"Fuller, Alexandra, 1969- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781594205866","Description":"258 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"BIOG FULLER","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":26,"SystemItemsTotal":30,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"The author of Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight traces her post-divorce confrontation of an upbringing in Africa that was overshadowed by the Rhodesian wars, her complicated parents and her courtship with her ex-husband.  --Publisher's description.","OCLC":"900011262","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":364,"ControlNumber":"908151","Title":"A spool of blue thread [sound recording (unabridged CD)]","Author":"Tyler, Anne.","Publisher":"New York : Random House Audio, 2015.","Edition":"Unabridged.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780553551037","Description":"11 sound discs (13 1\/2 hr.) : digital ; 4 3\/4 in.","WebLink":"http:\/\/midwesttapes.com\/images\/movies\/000\/000\/000\/011\/104\/000000000011104052.gif","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"2205","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":22,"CallNumber":"MCN CD FICTION TYL","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":2,"SystemItemsIn":14,"SystemItemsTotal":27,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"The Whitshanks are one of those families that radiate togetherness: an indefinable, enviable kind of specialness.

This wasn't just a body in a field. The corpse's shape was hers--same length, same curves. Then she knew, and everything else receded to nothingness. All she could see was a woman with the same nose, the same eyes, and the same face. Her twin. As an up-and-coming agent of the Commission for Discipline Inspection, Song Mei probes political corruption, not mysterious deaths. But that changes when she arrives on the scene of a grim police investigation and is confronted with a crime--and a victim--impossible to ignore. Despite strict orders and even threats from superiors, Mei knows there can be no turning away. Breaking protocol, Mei undertakes a covert search for the truth about the mystery woman's death--and life--by following in her footsteps from a factory plagued by worker suicides to a luxury hotel dealing in high-end escorts to an American home haunted by tragedy. But when Mei crosses paths with an ex-CIA operative on a shadowy mission of his own, her personal quest takes a jarring turn into political and industrial espionage that pits both agents against the highest ranks of communism and capitalism.

She takes us first into her family's tranquil, jasmine-scented days of prosperity in their luxury hotel in Mashhad, Iran. Their life is ruptured by the 1979 revolution as they flee: first to the safety of a mansion in Tehran, next to a squalid one-room flat in London, and finally to California, where they suffer a different kind of revolution. Struggling to adjust to a new host culture, they soon discover that although they escaped Iran, they are not free from their own lies and hidden truths. As the family comes to grips with their new home, the strength of their bonds are tested by love, loyalty, compassion, hate, pain, loss--and the will to survive.

Reflecting with gratitude on the exquisite beauty of her married life that was, grappling with the subsequent void, and feeling a re-energized devotion to her two teenage sons, Alexander channels her poetic sensibilities into a rich, lucid prose that describes a very personal and yet universal quest for meaning, understanding, and acceptance. She examines the journey we take in life through the lens of her own emotional and intellectual evolution, taking stock of herself at the midcentury mark. Because so much of her poetry is personal or autobiographical in nature, her transition to memoir is seamless, guided by her passionate belief in the power of language, her determination to share her voyage of self-discovery with her boys, and her embrace of the principle that the unexamined life is not worth living. This beautifully written book is for anyone who has loved and lost. It's about being strong when you want to collapse, about being grateful when someone has been stolen from you--it's discovering the truth in your life's journey: the good, the bad, and the ugly. It's Elizabeth Alexander's story but it is all of our stories because it is about discovering what matters\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"886490865","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":377,"ControlNumber":"908325","Title":"A fine romance","Author":"Bergen, Candice, 1946-","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Simon & Schuster hardcover edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780684808277 (hardcover)","Description":"x, 350 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":14,"SystemItemsTotal":22,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"883146799","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":378,"ControlNumber":"908329","Title":"For whom the bluebell tolls","Author":"Allen, Beverly (Novelist), author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"Berkley Prime Crime mass-market edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780425264980","Description":"294 pages ; 18 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Florist Audrey Bloom, co-owner of the Rose in Bloom, creates fragrant bouquets for brides.

Vivian longs to sing at the Stork Club instead of just shilling cigarettes there, but finds herself floundering in more ways than one. Together, the girls embark on a journey of self-discovery that will take them from the penthouse salons of Park Avenue to the Beat scene of Greenwich Village to Atlantic City's Steel Pier -- and into the arms of very different men who will alter their lives forever\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"867078193","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":381,"ControlNumber":"908345","Title":"Washington's revolution : the making of America's first leader","Author":"Middlekauff, Robert.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781101874233","Description":"xvi, 358 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, maps ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"973.34 MID","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":6,"SystemItemsTotal":12,"CurrentHoldRequests":8,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"880756781","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":382,"ControlNumber":"908346","Title":"Gateway to freedom : the hidden history of the underground railroad","Author":"Foner, Eric, 1943- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780393244076 (hbk.)","Description":"xiii, 301 pages, 24 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, maps ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":18,"SystemItemsTotal":19,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Eric Foner relates the dramatic story of fugitive slaves and the antislavery activists who defied the law to help them reach freedom.","OCLC":"900158156","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":383,"ControlNumber":"908276","Title":"The 20-minute body : 20 minutes, 20 days, 20 inches","Author":"Hoebel, Brett.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780062316783 (hardback)","Description":"259 pages : color illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"static.harpercollins.com\/harperimages\/isbn\/large\/3\/9780062316783.jpg","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"The former Biggest Loser star and celebrity trainer presents a high intensity workout and eating plan that delivers big results in just 20 minutes a day.From his days as a trainer on The Biggest Loser, Bret Hoebel knows that when people log hours on a treadmill, they'll lose weight. But he also knows that most of his clients don't have the schedule or the desire to spend that much time at the gym. And the truth is--the number of minutes you spend working out isn't the key to weight loss: intensity is.Time and again, Brett meets clients who've been making the same mistakes--not only are they focused on the clock, but they're also concentrating on fat burn and pounds lost as markers of success. And with a fat-first focus on losing weight, plateaus come quickly and often.But it's not about fat, it's about muscle.In The 20-Minute Body, Brett explains why the key to long-term weight loss is building muscle. The more lean muscle your body has, the more calories your body will burn at rest. Metabolic muscle is the secret to fast metabolism. And all you need is 20 minutes a day to create it.Additionally, when you focus on inches, not pounds, you'll find that you fit into your clothes better and love the shape of your body. Weight is misleading--muscle weighs more than fat, but it takes up far less room. So throw away the scale and invest in a tape measure to track your success. The 20-Minute Body will help you lose 20 inches--from around your stomach, hips, thighs, and arms--in just 20 days. All it takes is 20 minutes of exercise, paired with 20-minute meals that are focused on nutrient quality, not calorie counts.

The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) inspired and haunted an extraordinary number of exceptional artists and writers, including Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, Martha Gellhorn, Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, and John Dos Passos. The idealism of the cause--defending democracy from fascism at a time when Europe was darkening toward another world war--and the brutality of the conflict drew from them some of their best work: Guernica, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Homage to Catalonia, The Spanish Earth. The war spurred breakthroughs in military and medical technology as well. New aircraft, new weapons, new tactics and strategy all emerged in the intense Spanish conflict. Indiscriminate destruction raining from the sky became a dreaded reality for the first time. Progress also arose from the horror: the doctors and nurses who volunteered to serve with the Spanish defenders devised major advances in battlefield surgery and front-line blood transfusion. In those ways, and in many others, the Spanish Civil War served as a test bed for World War II, and for the entire twentieth century\" -- from publisher's web site.","OCLC":"883147932","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":387,"ControlNumber":"908367","Title":"Bookkeeping for dummies","Author":"Epstein, Lita, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"1118950364","Description":"xiv, 328 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":4,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Learn how to \"manage assets and liabilities; track business transactions accurately with ledgers and journals; prepare balance sheets, income statements, tax forms, payroll and more\"--Cover.","OCLC":"880965417","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"--For dummies.","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"--For dummies.\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":388,"ControlNumber":"908373","Title":"The age of cryptocurrency : how bitcoin and digital money are challenging the global economic order","Author":"Vigna, Paul.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781250065636","Description":"357 pages : illustrations ; 25 cm","WebLink":"http:\/\/www.netread.com\/jcusers2\/bk1388\/636\/9781250065636\/image\/lgcover.9781250065636.jpg","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":9,"SystemItemsTotal":11,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Bitcoin became a buzzword overnight. A cyber-enigma with an enthusiastic following, it pops up in headlines and fuels endless media debate. You can apparently use it to buy anything from coffee to cars, yet few people seem to truly understand what it is. This raises the question: Why should anyone care about bitcoin? In The Age of Cryptocurrency, Wall Street journalists Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey deliver the definitive answer to this question. Cybermoney is poised to launch a revolution, one that could reinvent traditional financial and social structures while bringing the world's billions of \"unbanked\" individuals into a new global economy. Cryptocurrency holds the promise of a financial system without a middleman, one owned by the people who use it and one safeguarded from the devastation of a 2008-type crash. But bitcoin, the most famous of the cybermonies, carries a reputation for instability, wild fluctuation, and illicit business; some fear it has the power to eliminate jobs and to upend the concept of a nation-state. It implies, above all, monumental and wide-reaching change--for better and for worse. But it is here to stay, and you ignore it at your peril.Vigna and Casey demystify cryptocurrency--its origins, its function, and what you need to know to navigate a cyber-economy. The digital currency world will look very different from the paper currency world; The Age of Cryptocurrency will teach you how to be ready\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"893784026","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":389,"ControlNumber":"908358","Title":"Persiana : recipes from the Middle East & beyond","Author":"Ghayour, Sabrina, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781566569958","Description":"240 pages : color illustrations ; 26 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"881469446","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":390,"ControlNumber":"908392","Title":"Sweet spot","Author":"Evanovich, Stephanie.","Publisher":"[Place of publication not identified] : Avon Books, 2015.","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"0062346687","Description":"1 v. ; 26 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":2,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"889165970","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":391,"ControlNumber":"908394","Title":"Microfarming for profit : from garden to glory","Author":"DeWitt, Dave, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Torrey House Press edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781937226381","Description":"159 pages : color illustrations ; 23 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"This guide gives prospective microfarmers the dirt on realistic essentials for turning a garden into a money-making enterprise.

Stewart restores James Madison, sometimes overshadowed by his fellow Founders, to his proper place as the most significant framer of the new nation. Short, plain, balding, neither soldier nor orator, low on charisma and high on intelligence, Madison cared more about achieving results than taking the credit. To reach his lifelong goal of a self-governing constitutional republic, he blended his talents with those of key partners. It was Madison who led the drive for the Constitutional Convention and pressed for an effective new government as his patron George Washington lent the effort legitimacy; Madison who wrote the Federalist Papers with Alexander Hamilton to secure the Constitution's ratification; Madison who corrected the greatest blunder of the Constitution by drafting and securing passage of the Bill of Rights with Washington's support; Madison who joined Thomas Jefferson to found the nation's first political party and move the nation toward broad democratic principles; Madison, with James Monroe, who guided the new nation through its first war in 1812, really its Second War of Independence; and it was Madison who handed the reins of government to the last of the Founders, his old friend and sometime rival Monroe. These were the main characters in his life. But it was his final partnership that allowed Madison to escape his natural shyness and reach the greatest heights. Dolley was the woman he married in middle age and who presided over both him and an enlivened White House. This partnership was a love story, a unique one that sustained Madison through his political rise, his presidency, and a fruitful retirement\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"883146752","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":397,"ControlNumber":"908502","Title":"A woman unknown : a Kate Shackleton mystery","Author":"Brody, Frances.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First U.S. edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781250037046 (hardcover)","Description":"vii, 374 pages ; 22 cm.","WebLink":"http:\/\/www.netread.com\/jcusers2\/bk1388\/046\/9781250037046\/image\/lgcover.9781250037046.jpg","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":12,"SystemItemsTotal":13,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"A winning combination of both intricate plotting and nostalgic post-WWI English country setting, A Woman Unknown will appeal to fans of both classic murder mysteries in the vein of Agatha Christie as well as readers of historical mystery series set in 1920s England, two popular subgenres.

Renowned negotiation expert William Ury has taught tens of thousands of people from all walks of life--managers, lawyers, factory workers, coal miners, schoolteachers, diplomats, and government officials--how to become better negotiators. Over the years, Ury has discovered that the greatest obstacle to successful agreements and satisfying relationships is not the other side, as difficult as they can be. The biggest obstacle is actually our own selves--our natural tendency to react in ways that do not serve our true interests. But this obstacle can also become our biggest opportunity, Ury argues. If we learn to understand and influence ourselves first, we lay the groundwork for understanding and influencing others. In this prequel to Getting to Yes, Ury offers a seven-step method to help you reach agreement with yourself first, dramatically improving your ability to negotiate with others.

Based on a hugely successful workshop, this book offers an interactive, enjoyable, motivating plan for women who want to take control of their finances and feel secure about the things that matter most to them. Too often, financial advice jumps right to the minutiae of investments, skipping over the deeper questions of what people really want from their money, both now and in the future. Ellen Rogin and Lisa Kueng teach their clients and workshop audiences to do the opposite. First, people need to think deeply about their short-term and long-term goals, whether they're as practical as paying for college and setting up a retirement plan or as aspirational as buying a sailboat and traveling the world. Only then should people start considering their investment options. Rogin and Kueng provide a clear, seven-step process for envisioning goals, designing a customized plan, and breaking the plan into manageable steps. Their fun voice, emphasis on positive thinking, and deep grasp of the nuances of investing will help women see the financial planning process as inspirational, full of possibility, and even fun.

John Hooper's entertaining and perceptive new book is the ideal companion for anyone seeking to understand contemporary Italy and the unique character of the Italians.

Looking at the facts that lie behind the stereotypes, he sheds new light on many aspects of Italian life: football and Freemasonry, sex, symbolism, and the reason why Italian has twelve words for a coat hanger, yet none for a hangover.

Back home, she finds herself imagining vivid scenes of violence and can't sleep or stop crying. It becomes clear that she is suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, triggered by her trip and seemingly exacerbated by her experiences in the other charged places she'd reported from. The bewilderment about this sudden loss of self-control is magnified by her feelings for Nico, a French soldier she met in Haiti who despite their brief connection seems to have found a place in her confused heart. With inspiring fearlessness, McClelland sets out to repair her broken psyche. Investigating her own illness and the history of PTSD, she discovers she is not alone: traumatic events have sweeping influence. While we most often connect it to veterans, PTSD is more often caused by other manner of trauma, and can even be contagious--close proximity to those afflicted can trigger it in those around them. As McClelland confronts the realities of her disorder, she learns to open her heart to the love that seems to have found her at an inopportune moment. Vivid, suspenseful, and intimate, Irritable Hearts is an unforgettable exploration of vulnerability and resilience, control and acceptance, and a compelling story of survival that expands the definition of what trauma is and offers powerful hope for those who need to work through it\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"889688480","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":416,"ControlNumber":"908866","Title":"Migratory animals","Author":"Specht, Mary Helen.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780062346032 (paperback)","Description":"294, 16 pages ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":4,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"879246122","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":417,"ControlNumber":"908869","Title":"Screen-smart parenting : how to find balance and benefit in your child's use of social media, apps, and digital devices","Author":"Gold, Jodi.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781462517947","Description":"xi, 314 pages ; 23 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Even for today's most tech-savvy parents, managing kids' technology use is a huge challenge fraught with uncertainties.

He was the clutch second baseman for the dominant New York Yankees of the 1950s. He then spent sixteen seasons managing in the big leagues, and is considered by anyone who knows baseball to have been a true baseball genius, a field manager without peer. Yet he's remembered more for his habit of kicking dirt on umpires, for being hired and fired by George Steinbrenner five times, and for his rabble rousing and public brawls. He was combative, fiery, intimidating, and controversial, yet beloved by the everyday fan. He was hard on his players and even harder on himself. He knew how to turn around a losing team like no one else--and how to entertain us every step of the way. Now, with his definitive biography Billy Martin, Pennington finally erases the caricature of Martin. Drawing on exhaustive interviews with friends, family, teammates, and countless adversaries, Pennington paints an indelible portrait of a man who never backed down for the game he loved. From his shantytown upbringing in a broken home; to his days playing for the Yankees when he almost always helped his team find a way to win; through sixteen years of managing, including his tenure in New York in the crosshairs of Steinbrenner and Reggie Jackson, Billy Martin made sure no one ever ignored him. And indeed no one could. He was the hero, the antihero, and the alter ego--or some combination of all three--for his short sixty-one years among us\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"885225364","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":422,"ControlNumber":"908897","Title":"A royal Fortune","Author":"Duarte, Judy, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780373658602","Description":"217 pages ; 17 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Jensen Fortune Chesterfield and rodeo rider Amber Rogers are from two different worlds, but their differences just might be the makings for true love in Horseback Hollow.","OCLC":"883132448","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Fortunes of Texas.

All of them are tested to the core when a local man discovers a graveyard of large steel toolboxes lying at the bottom of the harbor. Each box contains a grisly trove of human body parts. For Frank, the madman's clues are a tantalizing puzzle. For Eden and Eric, the case holds chilling links to a scarred childhood--and a murderous mentor named Hades. But the true evil goes beyond the bloody handiwork of a serial killer...\"--Page [4] of cover.","OCLC":"879583531","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":426,"ControlNumber":"908939","Title":"Girl before a mirror","Author":"Palmer, Liza, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780062297242","Description":"357, 8 pages ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"864092990","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":427,"ControlNumber":"908915","Title":"The water-wise home : how to conserve, capture, and reuse water in your home and landscape","Author":"Allen, Laura, 1976-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781612121697 (pbk. : alk. paper)","Description":"256 pages : illustrations ; 28 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"628.162 ALL","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":4,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"890462579","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":428,"ControlNumber":"908919","Title":"This is what you just put in your mouth? : from egg nog to beef jerky, the surprising secrets of what's inside everyday products","Author":"Di Justo, Patrick, 1964-","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780804139885","Description":"xii, 255 pages : illustrations ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":5,"SystemItemsTotal":5,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"894777752","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":429,"ControlNumber":"908944","Title":"Mr. Mac and me","Author":"Freud, Esther, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First U.S. edition","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781620408834","Description":"296 pages ; 22 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":9,"SystemItemsTotal":10,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"1914.

Lucinda Beckwith Long, the mayor of Athena, has donated a set of Civil War-era diaries to the archives of Athena College. The books were recently discovered among the personal effects of an ancestor of Mrs. Long's husband. The mayor would like Charlie to preserve and substantiate them as a part of the Long family legacy--something that could benefit her son, Beck, as he prepares to campaign for the state senate. Beck's biggest rival is Jasper Singletary. His Southern roots are as deep as Beck's, and their families have been bitter enemies since the Civil War. Jasper claims the Long clan has a history of underhanded behavior at the expense of the Singletarys. He'd like to get a look at the diaries in an attempt to expose the Long family's past sins. Meanwhile, a history professor at the college is also determined to get her hands on the books in a last-ditch bid for tenure. But their interest suddenly turns deadly...

While herding the family's goats on the mountain, Frederika happens upon the mutilated body of one of their neighbors, Eriksson. The death is dismissed as a wolf attack, but Maija feels certain that the wounds could only have been inflicted by another man. Compelled to investigate despite her neighbors' strange disinterest in the death and the fate of Eriksson's widow, Maija is drawn into the dark history of tragedies and betrayals that have taken place on Blackåsen. Young Frederika finds herself pulled towards the mountain as well, feeling something none of the adults around her seem to notice. As the seasons change, and the \"wolf winter,\" the harshest winter in memory, descends upon the settlers, Paavo travels to find work, and Maija finds herself struggling for her family's survival in this land of winter-long darkness. As the snow gathers, the settlers' secrets are increasingly laid bare.

What Eli knows for certain is that his mother went willingly, leaving her only son behind.

We follow all of the Roebuck family members, witnessing through each of them the painful, isolating effects of Eli's maniacal hunt, and find that each Roebuck is battling a monster of his or her own, sometimes literally. The magical world Shields has created is one of unicorns and lake monsters, ghosts and reincarnations, tricksters and hexes.

With his work in Montana completed now that the Callahan-Warren feud has ended in marriage rather than bloodshed, Degan Grant sets out for California because it is far away from the home he wants to forget--until the US Marshal who saved his life calls in a favor. All Degan has to do is apprehend three outlaws on the marshal's list and turn them over to the law. Easy enough, he figures, for a man no one wants to tangle with. But then a bold young woman crosses his path. Maxine grew up so pretty and attracted so much unwanted attention in her Texas hometown that events spiraled out of control. She will try anything to escape the handsome, enigmatic gunfighter who intends to turn her over to a corrupt sheriff who will hang her instead of putting her on trial. Saddled with a sassy, spirited young woman who insists she is innocent, Degan must hunt down a vicious killer and keep an old enemy at bay.

Used as a house of correction for sinning nuns, it lies in the north of the county in the middle of a vast wood and is run by the ambiguous Abbess Basilda and her close group of hard-faced acolytes. While walking about the grounds, Hildegard discovers the corpse of a young man in the morgue. His body bears deep gashes from neck to groin. His wounds appear to be the ravages of claws, but larger than any animal Hildegard knows of. Is it possible that the young man was killed by a dragon, as Hildegard's been told? Of course, Hildegard does not believe in dragons, and despite being warned against it, she goes for a walk in the woods. There she discovers a secret tower, locked and barred, with armed men on guard. What is so valuable that it needs such protection? Has it anything to do with the mystery of the young man's death? And why have assassins been pursuing the King's courier across the savage moor land only to murder him at a lonely wayside tavern?

The year is 1869, and the Civil War haunts the city of Philadelphia like a stubborn ghost. Mothers in black continue to mourn their lost sons. Photographs of the dead adorn dim sitting rooms. Maimed and broken men roam the streets. One of those men is Edward Clark, who is still tormented by what he saw during the war. Also constantly in his thoughts is another, more distant tragedy--the murder of his mother at the hands of his father, the famed magician Magellan Holmes...a crime that Edward witnessed when he was only ten. Now a crime reporter for one of the city's largest newspapers, Edward is asked to use his knowledge of illusions and visual trickery to expose the influx of mediums that descended on Philadelphia in the wake of the war. His first target is Mrs. Lucy Collins, a young widow who uses old-fashioned sleight of hand to prey on grieving families. Soon, Edward and Lucy become entwined in the murder of Lenora Grimes Pastor, the city's most highly regarded--and by all accounts, legitimate--medium, who dies mid-seance. With their reputations and livelihoods at risk, Edward and Lucy set out to find the real killer, and in the process unearth a terrifying hive of secrets that reaches well beyond Mrs. Pastor. Blending historical detail with flights of fancy, Things Half in Shadow is a riveting thriller where Medium and The Sixth Sense meet The Alienist--and where nothing is quite as it seems..\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"873006559","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":474,"ControlNumber":"910115","Title":"House broken","Author":"Yoerg, Sonja Ingrid, 1959- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780451472137 (paperback)","Description":"325 pages ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":7,"SystemItemsTotal":8,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"In this compelling and poignant debut novel, a woman skilled at caring for animals must learn to mend the broken relationships in her family.

Now, with two slippery teenagers of her own at home, the last thing she wants is to add Helen to the mix. But Geneva's husband convinces her that letting Helen live with them could be her golden chance to repair their relationship.

In The Brain That Changes Itself, Norman Doidge described the most important breakthrough in our understanding of the brain in four hundred years: the discovery that the brain can change its own structure and function in response to mental experience-what we call neuroplasticity. His revolutionary new book shows, for the first time, how the amazing process of neuroplastic healing really works. It describes natural, non-invasive avenues into the brain provided by the forms of energy around us-light, sound, vibration, movement-which pass through our senses and our bodies to awaken the brain's own healing capacities without producing unpleasant side effects. Doidge explores cases where patients alleviated years of chronic pain or recovered from debilitating strokes or accidents; children on the autistic spectrum or with learning disorders normalizing; symptoms of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral palsy radically improved, and other near-miracle recoveries. And we learn how to vastly reduce the risk of dementia with simple approaches anyone can use. For centuries it was believed that the brain's complexity prevented recovery from damage or disease. The Brain's Way of Healing shows that this very sophistication is the source of a unique kind of healing. As he did so lucidly in The Brain That Changes Itself, Doidge uses stories to present cutting-edge science with practical real-world applications, and principles that everyone can apply to improve their brain's performance and health\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"891494915","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":476,"ControlNumber":"909114","Title":"George Harrison : behind the locked door","Author":"Thomson, Graeme (Writer on music), author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"1468310658","Description":"xiv, 447 pages, 24 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, portraits ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":8,"SystemItemsTotal":9,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"881656131","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":477,"ControlNumber":"909115","Title":"George W.

A field is the oldest and simplest and truest measure of what a man needs in life, especially when looked at, contemplated, worked in, lived with, and written about. Dee's four fields, which he has known and studied for more than twenty years, are the fen field at the bottom of his private garden, a field in southern Zambia, a prairie in Little Bighorn, Montana, and a grass meadow in the Exclusion Zone at Chernobyl, Ukraine.

Starting with the mysterious Phoenicians and how sounds first came to be written down, he races on to show how nonsense poems work, pins down the strange story of OK, traces our five lost letters and tackles the tyranny of spelling, among many many other things.

He found their defenses woefully unprepared. At dawn the next morning, three North Vietnamese Army regiments--some 6,000 men--crossed the Cambodian border and attacked. Outnumbered three dozen to one, Albracht's men held off repeated ground assaults by communist forces with fierce hand-to-hand fighting, air support and a dangerously close B-52 strike. For days, the NVA blanketed Kate in a rain of rockets, mortars, artillery, machine guns, and small arms, blocking efforts to resupply, reinforce, or evacuate the outpost. Albracht continually exposed himself to enemy fire to direct air strikes, to guide re-supply helicopters, to distribute ammunition and water to his men, to retrieve the dead and to rescue the wounded, often shielding men with his own body. Wounded by rocket shrapnel, he refused medical attention or evacuation. Exhausted from days without sleep, he continued to rally his men to beat off each new enemy attack. After five days, Kate's defenders were out of ammo and water. Aerial resupply was suicidal, and reinforcements were denied by military commanders who had written off Kate. Albracht refused to surrender or die in place. Refusing to allow his men to surrender, Albracht led his troops, including many wounded, off the hill and on a daring night march through enemy lines. Abandoned in Hell is an astonishing memoir of leadership, sacrifice, and brutal violence, a riveting journey into Vietnam's heart of darkness, and a compelling reminder of the transformational power of individual heroism. Not since Lone Survivor and We Were Soldiers Once, And Young has there been such a gripping and authentic account of battlefield courage.

In this new era, patients will control their data and be emancipated from a paternalistic medical regime in which \"the doctor knows best.\" Mobile phones, apps, and attachments will literally put the lab and the ICU in our pockets. Computers will replace physicians for many diagnostic tasks, and enormous data sets will give us new means to attack conditions that have long been incurable.

Having studied and taught at schools such as Harvard University, Yale Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Guinier has spent years examining the experiences of ethnic minorities at the nation's top institutions of higher education, and here she lays bare the practices that impede the stated missions of these schools. Guinier argues for reformation, not only of the very premises of admissions practices but of the shape of higher education itself, and she offers many examples of new collaborative initiatives that prepare students for engaged citizenship in our increasingly multicultural society\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"892794498","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":490,"ControlNumber":"910181","Title":"Who's afraid of academic freedom?","Author":"","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780231168809","Description":"xvii, 428 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"886878395","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":491,"ControlNumber":"910244","Title":"Forbidden to love the duke","Author":"Hunter, Jillian.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780451470133","Description":"342 pages ; 18 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"883367151","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Hunter, Jillian.

For years, the home has cared for London's flower girls--orphaned and crippled children living on the grimy streets and selling posies of violets and watercress to survive. Soon after she arrives, Tilly discovers a diary written by an orphan named Florrie--a young Irish flower girl who died of a broken heart after she and her sister, Rosie, were separated. Moved by Florrie's pain and all she endured in her brief life, Tilly sets out to discover what happened to Rosie. But the search will not be easy. Full of twists and surprises, it leads the caring and determined young woman into unexpected places, including the depths of her own heart.\"--Publisher's website.","OCLC":"897485877","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":500,"ControlNumber":"910275","Title":"My sunshine away","Author":"Walsh, M.

By various estimates, more than a million Armenians were killed and the survivors were scattered across the world. Although it is now a century old, the issue of what most of the world calls the Armenian Genocide of 1915 has not been consigned to history. It is a live and divisive political issue that mobilizes Armenians across the world, touches the identity and politics of modern Turkey, and has consumed the attention of U.S. politicians for years. In Great Catastrophe, the eminent scholar and reporter Thomas de Waal looks at the changing narratives and politics of the Armenian Genocide and tells the story of recent efforts by courageous Armenians, Kurds, and Turks to come to terms with the disaster as Turkey enters a new post-Kemalist era. The story of what happened to the Armenians in 1915-16 is well-known. Here we are told the much less well-known story of what happened to Armenians, Kurds, and Turks in its aftermath. First Armenians were divided between the Soviet Union and a worldwide diaspora, with different generations and communities of Armenians constructing new identities, while bitter intra-Armenian quarrels sometimes broke out into violence. In Turkey, the Armenian issue was initially forgotten and suppressed, only to return to the political agenda in the context of the Cold War, an outbreak of Armenian terrorism in the 1970s and the growth of modern 'identity politics' in the age of genocide-consciousness. In the last decade, Turkey has begun to confront its taboos and finally face up to the Armenian issue. New, more sophisticated histories are being written of the deportations of 1915, now with the collaboration of Turkish scholars. In Turkey itself there has been an astonishing revival of oral history, with tens of thousands of people coming out of the shadows to reveal a long-suppressed Armenian identity. However, a normalization process between the Armenian and Turkish states broke down in 2010. Drawing on archival sources, reportage and moving personal stories, de Waal tells the full story of Armenian-Turkish relations since the Genocide in all its extraordinary twists and turns. He strips away the propaganda to look both at the realities of a terrible historical crime and also the divisive 'politics of genocide' it produced. The book throws light not only on our understanding of Armenian-Turkish relations but also of how mass atrocities and historical tragedies shape contemporary politics\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"893202609","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":505,"ControlNumber":"910383","Title":"The opposite of spoiled : raising kids who are grounded, generous, and smart about money","Author":"Lieber, Ron, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780062247018 (hbk.)","Description":"xii, 240 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":18,"SystemItemsTotal":22,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Lieber covers all the basics: the best ways to handle the tooth fairy, allowance, chores, charity, savings, birthdays, holidays, cell phones, splurging, clothing, cars, part-time jobs, and college tuition.

It's not because she's Black--most of the other students in the fourth-grade class at her West Philadelphia elementary school are too. Maybe it's because she celebrates Kwanzaa, or because she's forbidden from reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Maybe it's because she calls her father--a housepainter-slash-philosopher--\"Baba\" instead of \"Daddy,\" or because her parents' friends gather to pour out libations \"from the Creator, for the Martyrs\" and discuss \"the community.\" Kenya does know that it's connected to what her Baba calls \"the shame of being alive\"--a shame that only grows deeper and more complex over the course of Asali Solomon's long-awaited debut novel. Disgruntled, effortlessly funny and achingly poignant, follows Kenya from West Philadelphia to the suburbs, from public school to private, from childhood through adolescence, as she grows increasingly disgruntled by her inability to find any place or thing or person that feels like home. A coming-of-age tale, a portrait of Philadelphia in the late eighties and early nineties, an examination of the impossible double-binds of race, Disgruntled is a novel about the desire to rise above the limitations of the narratives we're given and the painful struggle to craft fresh ones we can call our own\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"887605494","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":512,"ControlNumber":"910480","Title":"Love by the book : [a novel]","Author":"Pimentel, Melissa, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780143127284 (pbk.)","Description":"320, 1 pages ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Feeling old before her time, Lauren moves to London in search of the fab single life replete with sexy Englishmen.

But on a mission in Tunisia to deliver a package to safety, Byron is dismayed to find that the precious cargo is actually a hostage rescue, and that his orders are to take Damara Petrakis back to US soil and hide her in plain sight--as his newlywed wife. Back in Byron's hometown of Glory, Kansas, petite, fierce Damara keeps surprising him; she may be royalty, but she's fully trained in martial arts and will sacrifice anything for her country. As the town rallies around the returning hero and his bride-to-be, he's finding that it's way too easy to play the part, and after the hell he has seen, that terrifies him.

Her father, Maharajah Duleep Singh, was heir to the Kingdom of the Sikhs, one of the greatest empires of the Indian subcontinent, a realm that stretched from the lush Kashmir Valley to the craggy foothills of the Khyber Pass and included the mighty cities of Lahore and Peshawar. It was a territory irresistible to the British, who plundered everything, including the fabled Koh-I-Noor diamond. Exiled to England, the dispossessed Maharajah transformed his estate at Elveden in Suffolk into a Moghul palace, its grounds stocked with leopards, monkeys and exotic birds. Sophia, god-daughter of Queen Victoria, was raised a genteel aristocratic Englishwoman: presented at court, afforded grace and favor lodgings at Hampton Court Palace and photographed wearing the latest fashions for the society pages. But when, in secret defiance of the British government, she travelled to India, she returned a revolutionary. Sophia transcended her heritage to devote herself to battling injustice and inequality, a far cry from the life to which she was born. Her causes were the struggle for Indian Independence, the fate of the lascars, the welfare of Indian soldiers in the First World War--and, above all, the fight for female suffrage. She was bold and fearless, attacking politicians, putting herself in the front line and swapping her silks for a nurse's uniform to tend wounded soldiers evacuated from the battlefields.

She decides to take some time off work to research her idea for a screenplay: the true story of a scandalous adulterous love affair that took place in Amherst, Massachusetts, in the 1880s. The lovers were a young faculty wife at Amherst College, Mabel Loomis Todd, and the college's treasurer, Austin Dickinson. Austin, twenty-four years Mabel's senior and married, was the brother of the reclusive poet Emily Dickinson and their trysts took place in Emily's house (with her consent). Alice travels to Amherst, staying in the house of a friend of a friend, Nick Crocker, a married English academic in his fifties. As Alice researches the affair between Austin and Mabel, and puzzles out Emily Dickinson's role, she embarks on an affair with Nick, an affair that, of course, they both know echoes the affair that she's writing about in her screenplay. Interspersed with Alice's own complicated love story is the story she is telling of Austin and Mabel, historically accurate, and meticulously recreated from their voluminous letters and diaries. Using the poems of Emily Dickinson throughout, Amherst is an exploration of the nature of passionate love, its delusions, and its glories. This novel is playful and scholarly, sexy and smart, and reminds us that the games we play when we fall in love have not changed that much over the years\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"885313129","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":558,"ControlNumber":"910633","Title":"In every way : a novel","Author":"Brown, Nic, 1977-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781619024595 (hardcover)","Description":"269 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":8,"SystemItemsTotal":10,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Chapel Hill college student Maria finds herself in a predicament-unexpectedly pregnant at nineteen.

So when her mother proposes an extended trip to sleepy coastal town Beaufort-the same town that the adoptive couple Maria chose for her daughter just happens to live in-Maria jumps at the chance to escape. Perhaps not surprisingly, Maria finds herself listless and bored soon after her arrival in Beaufort, and a summer job seems like a cure. She has kept close watch on the couple she chose to adopt her daughter-they live mere blocks away-and, as opportunity demands, she accepts a position as their nanny. Maria ingratiates herself into the family-hesitantly, at first, and then with all the confused and chaotic fervor of a mother separated from her child.

Now, as governments around the world open their files and records on internal UFO investigations, the US remains steadfast in its denial of interest in the UFO issue. As more of the world's population accepts the possibility of an extraterrestrial presence, the demand is building for disclosure from the United States. Using newly declassified and Freedom of Information Act documents, eyewitness accounts, interviews, and leaked documents being authenticated, THE PRESIDENTS AND UFOS details the secret history of UFOs and the corresponding presidential administration. Starting in 1941 with the Roosevelt administration, author Larry Holcombe examines the startling discoveries facing a president preoccupied by WWII, the explosion of UFO sightings during the Truman years, first contact during the Eisenhower administration, and the possibility of a UFO connection to the Kennedy assassination. In 1975, the Nixon administration came very close to admitting that UFOs exist by funding a documentary by Robert Emenegger. Almost 40 years later, this book will examine Emenegger's findings. For the first time, the involvement of all of the modern presidents up to and including President Obama, and the rise and then fall of their influence on UFO issues, are told in one story that is an integral part of the fascinating UFO tapestry\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"876349592","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":568,"ControlNumber":"910995","Title":"Convincing the rancher","Author":"McEwen, Claire, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780373608942 (Larger print paperback)","Description":"378 pages ; 17 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"900842167","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Harlequin super romance.

Wide-Open World follows the Marshall family as they volunteer their way around the globe, living in a monkey sanctuary in Costa Rica, teaching English in rural Thailand, and caring for orphans in India. There's a name for this kind of endeavor--voluntourism--and it might just be the future of travel. Oppressive heat, grueling bus rides, backbreaking work, and one vicious spider monkey. Best family vacation ever! John Marshall needed a change. His twenty-year marriage was falling apart, his seventeen-year-old son was about to leave home, and his fourteen-year-old daughter was lost in cyberspace. Desperate to get out of a rut and reconnect with his family, John dreamed of a trip around the world, a chance to leave behind, if only just for a while, routines and responsibilities. He didn't have the money for resorts or luxury tours, but he did have an idea that would make traveling the globe more affordable and more meaningful than he'd ever imagined: The family would volunteer their time and energy to others in far-flung locales. Wide-Open World is the inspiring true story of the six months that changed the Marshall family forever. Once they'd made the pivotal decision to go, John and his wife, Traca, quit their jobs, pulled their kids out of school, and embarked on a journey that would take them far off the beaten path, and far out of their comfort zones. Here is the totally engaging, bluntly honest chronicle of the Marshalls' life-altering adventure from Central America to East Asia. It was no fairy tale. The trip offered little rest, even less relaxation, and virtually no certainty of what was to come. But it did give the Marshalls something far more valuable: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to conquer personal fears, strengthen family bonds, and find their true selves by helping those in need. In the end, as John discovered, he and his family did not change the world. It was the world that changed them. Advance praise for Wide-Open World \"For anyone who has ever imagined what it would be like to pack up, unplug, pull the kids out of school, and travel around the world, this volunteer adventure is your ticket. Wide-Open World will move, engage, and inspire you, even if you never leave the couch.\"--Christina Baker Kline, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Orphan Train \"John Marshall has done it, written a big, honest, charming memoir about the dream--and reality--of escaping it all, on a round-the-globe boondoggle with your family. In Wide-Open World, the pleasures are deep, the sentiments revelatory, and the voice true and funny. And best of all, you won't have to leave your armchair, or upend your life, to know what it feels like to make your way, with kids, out there in the beautiful, churning world.\"--Michael Paterniti, author of Love and Other Ways of Dying \"Volunteering may not change the world--but as we learn in Wide-Open World, it will change you and your family. Let this heartwarming, hilarious, poignant book be your inspiration: Dare to follow in the Marshall family's footsteps, and give more of your time, effort, and heart than you ever thought possible--and watch the blessings flow!\"--Sy Montgomery, author of The Good Good Pig \"Compelling, richly detailed, and often laugh-out-loud funny.\"--Gwen Cooper, author of Homer's Odyssey\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"879915403","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":588,"ControlNumber":"911201","Title":"The age of acquiescence : the life and death of American resistance to organized wealth and power","Author":"Fraser, Steve, 1945-","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780316185431 (hardback)","Description":"viii, 470 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":11,"SystemItemsTotal":12,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"A groundbreaking investigation of how and why, from the 18th century to the present day, American resistance to our ruling elites has vanished. From the American Revolution through the Civil Rights movement, Americans have long mobilized against political, social, and economic privilege. Hierarchies based on inheritance, wealth, and political preferment were treated as obnoxious and a threat to democracy. Mass movements envisioned a new world supplanting dog-eat-dog capitalism. But over the last half-century that political will and cultural imagination have vanished. Why? THE AGE OF ACQUIESCENCE seeks to solve that mystery. Steve Fraser's account of national transformation brilliantly examines the rise of American capitalism, the visionary attempts to protect the democratic commonwealth, and the great surrender to today's delusional fables of freedom and the politics of fear.

When journalist Patrick Bracken returns to Gohen, the Irish village where he was born, he knows the eyes of the townspeople are on him. He has come home to investigate two deaths that happened decades earlier when he was a child, deaths that were ruled accidental. But Patrick knows-and believes the whole town knows-they were murders. He knows because he and his best friend, Mikey Lamb, were witnesses. And so Patrick goes to see eighty-year-old Sam Howard, the lawyer who conducted the inquest into the death of missionary priest Jarlath Coughlin. As he questions Sam and Sam's vibrant, loving, gossipy wife, Elsie, he seeks acknowledgment of a cover-up and an explanation of why the Protestant establishment would help conceal a crime among Catholics. During their give-and-take-about this and the nearly simultaneous shotgun death of Lawrence Gorman (aka Doul Yank)-what emerges from their collective memories are a pungent, wry portrait of village life in Ireland and a tangle of human relationships, some twisted and some that show our better side\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"895500615","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":594,"ControlNumber":"911262","Title":"Black dog summer : a novel","Author":"Sherry, Miranda.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781476779027 (hardback)","Description":"246 pages ; 24 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"In this debut novel a mother watches from the afterlife as her teenage daughter recovers amidst the startling dysfunction of her extended family.","OCLC":"883147350","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":595,"ControlNumber":"911269","Title":"The long and faraway gone","Author":"Berney, Louis, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780062292438","Description":"456 pages ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":5,"SystemItemsTotal":6,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"In the summer of 1986, two tragedies rocked Oklahoma City.

The school's green quads are lined by gothic stone halls, students dart across campus in blazers and bright plaid skirts. Fresh out of college and barely older than the students he teaches, Charlie longs to find his place in the rarefied world of Abbottsford. He is particularly drawn to the school chaplain, Preston Bankhead, and Preston's beautiful daughter, May. Then, Charlie's younger half brother, Nick, arrives on campus. Nick is, quite literally, the golden child, with sandy blond hair and a dazzling smile. Teachers welcome him warmly, students stay late to talk after class, and May Bankhead proves susceptible to his magnetic draw. As Charlie sees the unmistakable connection between his first love and his half brother, he struggles with emotions far more complicated than mere jealousy. A terrible secret threatens to surface, and Charlie's peaceful campus life is shattered. A complex, sexy, page-turning novel, Holly LeCraw's latest asks us just how much we will sacrifice to protect those we love and how far we will go to keep the past safely buried\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"886672416","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":601,"ControlNumber":"911378","Title":"Find me","Author":"Van den Berg, Laura, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780374154714 (hbk.)","Description":"280 pages ; 22 cm","WebLink":"http:\/\/www.netread.com\/jcusers2\/bk1388\/714\/9780374154714\/image\/lgcover.9780374154714.jpg","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":13,"SystemItemsTotal":14,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Find Me is the story of a young woman reckoning with the ghosts of her past in a post-epidemic America\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"890107249","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":602,"ControlNumber":"911379","Title":"Housewitch","Author":"Schickel, Katie.","Publisher":"New York : Forge, 2015","Edition":"1st ed.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780765377302 : HRD","Description":"352 p. ; 22 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"FICTION SCH","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":6,"SystemItemsTotal":7,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"897485797","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":603,"ControlNumber":"911380","Title":"Blue stars","Author":"Tedrowe, Emily Gray, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781250052483 (hbk.)","Description":"344 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"http:\/\/www.netread.com\/jcusers2\/bk1388\/483\/9781250052483\/image\/lgcover.9781250052483.jpg","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":9,"SystemItemsTotal":10,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Emily Gray Tedrowe has written an extraordinary novel about ordinary people, a graceful and gritty portrayal of what it's like for the women whose husbands and sons are deployed in Iraq. BLUE STARS brings to life the realities of the modern day home front: how to get through the daily challenges of motherhood and holding down a job while bearing the stress and uncertainty of war, when everything can change in an instant. It tells the story of Ellen, a Midwestern literature professor, who is drawn into the war when her legal ward Michael enlists as a Marine; and of Lacey, a proud Army wife who struggles to pay the bills and keep things going for her son while her husband is deployed. Ellen and Lacey cope with the fear and stress of a loved one at war while trying to get by in a society that often ignores or misunderstands what war means to women today. When Michael and Eddie are injured in Iraq, Ellen and Lacey's lives become intertwined in Walter Reed Army Hospital, where each woman must live while caring for her wounded soldier. They form an alliance, and an unlikely friendship, while helping each other survive the dislocated world of the army hospital. Whether that means fighting for proper care for their men, sharing a six-pack, or coping with irrevocable loss, Ellen and Lacey pool their strengths to make it through. In the end, both women are changed, not only by the war and its fallout, but by each other. \"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"892804065","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":604,"ControlNumber":"911381","Title":"Half the world","Author":"Abercrombie, Joe.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First U.S. edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780804178426 (hardcover : acid-free paper)","Description":"366 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":12,"SystemItemsTotal":13,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"New York Times bestselling author Joe Abercrombie's thrilling new series continues in the follow-up to Half a King, which George R. R. Martin hailed as \"a fast-paced tale of betrayal and revenge that grabbed me from page 1 and refused to let go.\" Sometimes a girl is touched by Mother War. Thorn is such a girl. Desperate to avenge her dead father, she lives to fight. But she has been named a murderer by the very man who trained her to kill. Sometimes a woman becomes a warrior. She finds herself caught up in the schemes of Father Yarvi, Gettland's deeply cunning minister. Crossing half the world to find allies against the ruthless High King, she learns harsh lessons of blood and deceit. Sometimes a warrior becomes a weapon. Beside her on the journey is Brand, a young warrior who hates to kill, a failure in his eyes and hers, but with one chance at redemption. And weapons are made for one purpose. Will Thorn forever be a pawn in the hands of the powerful, or can she carve her own path? Praise for Joe Abercrombie's Half a King \"Half a King is my favorite book by Joe Abercrombie so far, and that's saying something.\"--Patrick Rothfuss \"As in all Abercrombie's books, friends turn out to be enemies, enemies turn out to be friends; the line between good and evil is murky indeed; and nothing goes quite as we expect. With eye-popping plot twists and rollicking good action, Half a King is definitely a full adventure.\"--Rick Riordan \"Enthralling! An up-all-night read.\"--Robin Hobb \"Polished and sharp, perhaps his most technically proficient novel yet. I dare you to read the first chapter and try not to turn the next page.\"--Brent Weeks \"Half a King can be summed up in a single word: masterpiece. It's a coming-of-age story. It's a Viking saga. It's a revenge tale and family drama and the return of the prodigal son. But most of all, it's this: a short time alongside people as weak and blundering as we are and, in the midst of it all, as heroic. Far too short a time, as it turns out.

Like everyone else in the waiting area, he is sifting through airport pages on his laptop, and then through news sites, social pages, corridors of trivia...until he happens to stumble on information about an image on a famous shroud in Turin. The image itself isn't even visible on the shroud; it only emerged when some amateur photographer looked at the negative of a shot he'd taken and saw the figure--Christ's body supine after crucifixion. Only in the negative: the negative became a positive. A few decades later when the shroud was radiocarbon dated, it turned out to come from no later than the mid-thirteenth century. But that didn't trouble the believers. Things like that never do. A \"corporate ethnographer,\" U. is tasked with writing the Great Report. Yet at every turn, U. finds himself overwhelmed by the ubiquity of data, lost in a buffer zone and wandering through a crowd of apparitions. Meanwhile, Madison, the woman he is seeing, becomes increasingly elusive, much like the particulars in the case of the recent, highly-publicized parachutist's death, with which U. is obsessed. He also develops a perverse interest in oil spills, spending great amounts of time watching loops of clean up videos. As U. begins to wonder if perhaps the Great Report will remain a shapeless, oozing plasma, his senses are reawakened by an ominous dream of an apocalyptic cityscape.

Brimming with the luminous insight, humor, and compassion that are Anne Tyler's hallmarks, this capacious novel takes us across three generations of the Whitshanks, their shared stories and long-held secrets, all the unguarded and richly lived moments that combine to define who and what they are as a family.","OCLC":"885228496","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"[large print]","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":619,"ControlNumber":"911511","Title":"The whole life fertility plan : understanding what affects your fertility to help you get pregnant when you want to","Author":"Phillips, Kyra.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780373892969","Description":"xxx, 257 pages : illustrations ; 22 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"A proactive and comprehensive guide to help you understand and preserve your fertility options.

In THE WHOLE LIFE FERTILITY PLAN, Kyra Phillips and Dr. Jamie Grifo answer all your pressing questions about fertility health-and address things you didn't even know to ask-whether you're planning to wait to have kids or are starting the process now. Phillips spent hers 20s and 30s building her career, and wasn't ready to start a family until she turned 40. She met with Dr. Grifo, the director at the renowned NYU Fertility Health Center, and after an uphill (but ultimately successful) battle on the road to conception, she learned that there were a number of things-simple things-she could have been doing differently over the years that would have made the process smoother. For too long, women have believed that when it came to their fertility, their bodies would cooperate when the time was right. But fertility is not unlike heart health; it's important to be proactive. As women are becoming increasingly aware of their fertility health and waiting longer to have children, they are starting to take control of their fertility long before they are ready to start trying.

Dramatically different, they become bitter enemies, even as children: one good, one bad. One leaves his peaceful hometown, but when all else fails, the prodigal son returns, twenty years later. The reunion of brothers, sweet and healing at first, exposes shattering revelations of good and evil. #1 New York Times bestselling author Danielle Steel tells a brilliant, suspenseful story of suspicion, betrayal, and a life-and-death struggle for survival. Which twin is good and which is evil, as the tables turn again and again? PRODIGAL SON In a matter of days, Peter McDowell loses everything he has worked so hard for--his wealth, his property, his livelihood as a star investment banker. And then it gets worse. The stock market crash not only plunges Peter into joblessness, it causes a rift in his marriage that he cannot repair. Stripped of everything, he has only one place to retreat: a lakeside cottage he inherited from his parents, who left most of their modest estate to Peter's twin. With no other choice, the prodigal son goes home. A beloved small-town doctor, a devoted family man, and a pillar of his community, Michael McDowell serves others without regard to personal gain. Only Peter knows how Michael manipulated their parents when the boys were young, ultimately driving Peter away. At first, he dreads seeing Michael again. But, to his surprise, their reunion is tender and real. Only later, as Peter mulls over his late mother's journals, does the truth begin to emerge, as realization and panic set in. Who is his twin? Is the façade real, or does something terrifying lie beneath? Imagination or a reality too terrifying to believe? In a race for time, Peter throws caution to the winds to find the truth. What he discovers will change their lives, the lives of their children, and an entire town forever. Powerful, poignant, and filled with complex and layered characters, Prodigal Son is a riveting novel of secrets, salvation, and redemption from master storyteller Danielle Steel\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"889688454","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":628,"ControlNumber":"911720","Title":"I am radar","Author":"Larsen, Reif.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781594206160 (hardcover)","Description":"656 pages : map ; 25 cm","WebLink":"ftp:\/\/ppftpuser:welcome@ftp01.penguingroup.com\/Booksellers and Media\/Covers\/2008_2009_New_Covers\/9781594206160.jpg","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":11,"SystemItemsTotal":13,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"The moment just before Radar Radmanovic is born, all of the hospital's electricity mysteriously fails. The delivery takes place in total darkness. Lights back on, the staff sees a healthy baby boy-with pitch-black skin-born to the stunned white parents. No one understands the uncanny electrical event or the unexpected skin color. \"A childbirth is an explosion,\" the ancient physician says by way of explanation. \"Some shrapnel is inevitable, isn't it?\" A kaleidoscopic novel both heartbreaking and dazzling, Reif Larsen's I Am Radar begins with Radar's perplexing birth but rapidly explodes outward, carrying readers across the globe and throughout history, as well as to unknown regions where radio waves and subatomic particles dance to their own design. Spanning this extraordinary range with grace and empathy, humor and courage, I Am Radar is the vessel where a century of conflict and art unite in a mesmerizing narrative whole. Deep in arctic Norway, a cadre of Norwegian schoolteachers is imprisoned during the Second World War. Founding a radical secret society that will hover on the margins of recorded history for decades to come, these schoolteachers steal radioactive material from a hidden Nazi nuclear reactor and use it to stage a surreal art performance on a frozen coastline. This strange society appears again in the aftermath of Cambodia's murderous Khmer Rouge regime, when another secret performance takes place but goes horrifically wrong. Echoes of this disaster can be heard during the Yugoslavian wars, when an avant-garde puppeteer finds himself trapped inside Belgrade, while his brother serves in the genocidal militia that attacks Srebrenica. Decades later, in the war-torn Congo, a disfigured literature professor assembles the largest library in the world even as the country around him collapses. All of these stories are linked by Radar-now a gifted radio operator living in the New Jersey Meadowlands-who struggles with love, a set of hapless parents, and a terrible medical affliction that he has only just begun to comprehend. As I Am Radar accelerates toward its unforgettable conclusion, these divergent strands slowly begin to converge, revealing that beneath our apparent differences, unseen harmonies secretly unite our lives. Drawing on the furthest reaches of quantum physics, forgotten history, and mind-bending art, Larsen's I Am Radar is a triumph of storytelling at its most primal, elegant, and epic: a breathtaking journey through humanity's darkest hours only to arrive at a place of shocking wonder and redemption\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881888191","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":629,"ControlNumber":"911727","Title":"The automatic customer : creating a subscription business in any industry","Author":"Warrillow, John, 1971-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781591847465","Description":"218 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"How smart companies can use subscriptions to win customers, increase cash flow, and ignite growth What do Zipcar, Netflix, and WhatsApp have in common?

Alice is a young woman living on her father-in-law's farm on the edge of an Australian country town, while her husband is held prisoner in Europe. When Giancarlo, an Italian anarchist at the prisoner-of-war camp down the road, is assigned to work on the farm, she hopes that being kind to him will somehow influence her husband's treatment. What she doesn't anticipate is how dramatically Giancarlo will expand her outlook and self-knowledge. But what most challenges Alice and her fellow townspeople is the utter foreignness of the thousand-plus Japanese inmates and their culture, which the camp commanders fatally misread. Mortified by being taken alive in battle and preferring a violent death to the shame of living, they plan an outbreak, to shattering and far-reaching effects on all the citizens around them. In a career spanning half a century, Thomas Keneally has proved a master at exploring ordinary lives caught up in extraordinary events.

Hardworking and popular in their community, they have a loving marriage and thriving business, but Alice still feels that something is missing, lying just beyond reach.

In this elegant novel, the lives of Alice and Carla will intersect in a profound and surprising way. Poignant and arresting, The Same Sky is about finding courage through struggle, hope amid heartache, and summoning the strength--no matter what dangers await--to find the place where you belong. Advance praise for The Same Sky \"The Same Sky is the timeliest book you will read this year--a wrenching, honest, painstakingly researched novel that puts a human face to the story of undocumented youth desperately seeking their dreams in America. When I finished, all I wanted to do was write my congressional representatives and tell them to read it, ASAP. This one's going to haunt me for a long time--and it's going to define the brilliant Amanda Eyre Ward as a leading author of socially conscious fiction.\"--Jodi Picoult \"Riveting, heart-rending, and beautifully written, The Same Sky pulled me in on the first page and held my attention all the way to its perfect conclusion.

She is probably best known for her notorious affair with Carl Jung, which was dramatized in the film A Dangerous Method, starring Keira Knightley. Yet her life story is much more compelling than just one famous relationship. Spielrein overcame family and psychological abuse to become a profoundly original thinker in her own right. Sex Versus Survival is the first biography to put her life and ideas at the center of the story and examine Spielrein's key role in the development of psychoanalysis. Drawing on fresh research into Spielrein's diaries, papers, and correspondence, John Launer shows how Spielrein's overlooked ideas--rejected by Freud and Jung but substantially vindicated by later developments in psychology and evolutionary biology--may represent the last and most important stage in the rediscovery of an extraordinary life.","OCLC":"881094023","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":653,"ControlNumber":"911921","Title":"Future crimes : everything is connected, everyone is vulnerable and what we can do about it","Author":"Goodman, Marc. author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780385539005","Description":"viii, 392, lx pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":17,"SystemItemsTotal":19,"CurrentHoldRequests":1,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"An FBI futurist and senior advisor to Interpol analyzes the digital underground to reveal the alarming ways criminals, corporations and countries are using emerging technologies to target individuals and wage war.","OCLC":"893857964","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":654,"ControlNumber":"911922","Title":"Going to pot : why the rush to legalize marijuana is harming America","Author":"Bennett, William J.

The Resistance grows stronger against the invaders, for it is up to the young people of the Earth to lead the battle and save humanity. Syl Hellais, conceived among the stars, is the oldest alien child on Earth. The daughter of one of the planet's rulers, she has hidden gifts and powers that she does yet fully understand. But all is not as it seems. Secret experiments are being conducted on humans, the Illyri are at war among themselves, and the sinister Nairene Sisterhood has arrived on Earth, hungry for new blood. When Syl helps a pair of young fighters escape execution, she finds herself sentenced to death and pursued by her own kind. Soon, she even risks breaking the greatest taboo of her race by falling in love with a human. Now the hunter has become the hunted, and the predators have become prey.

His stories are at once timeless and of-the-moment, and his themes are universal: love, language, ambition, power, corruption, religion, family, identity. Here he explores this terrain from a different angle in essays that deftly counterpoise the personal and the political, and are shot through with the same passion, imagination, and breathtaking shifts of perspective that gives his fiction its unmistakable electric charge. A \"water lily\" who has called three countries on three continents his home-Pakistan, the birthplace to which he returned as a young father; the United States, where he spent his childhood and young adulthood; and Britain, where he married and became a citizen-Hamid writes about overlapping worlds with fluidity and penetrating insight. Whether he is discussing courtship rituals or pop culture, drones or the rhythms of daily life in an extended family compound, he transports us beyond the scarifying headlines of an anxious West and a volatile East, beyond stereotype and assumption, and helps to bring a dazzling diverse global culture within emotional and intellectual reach. \"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"890799084","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":671,"ControlNumber":"912034","Title":"Country [large print] : a novel","Author":"Steel, Danielle, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"[Large print edition]","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780804194631","Description":"418 pages (large print) ; 26 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"2701","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":27,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":7,"SystemItemsTotal":20,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"897423861","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"[large print] :","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":672,"ControlNumber":"912061","Title":"Murder with fried chicken and waffles.","Author":"Herbert, A.

Over a decade into the United States' \"global war on terror,\" PTSD afflicts as many as 30 percent of the conflict's veterans. But the disorder's reach extends far beyond the armed forces. In total, some twenty-seven million Americans are believed to be PTSD survivors. Yet to many of us, the disorder remains shrouded in mystery, secrecy, and shame.Now, David J. Morris -- a war correspondent, former Marine, and PTSD sufferer himself -- has written the essential account of this illness.

In many public schools, students are spending up to 28% of instructional time on testing and test prep. Starting this year, the introduction of the Common Core State Standards Initiative in 45 states will bring an unprecedented level of new, more difficult, and longer mandatory tests to nearly every classroom in the nation up to five times a year-forcing our national testing obsession to a crisis point. Taxpayers are spending extravagant money on these tests-up to $1.4 billion per year-and excessive tests are stunting children's spirits, adding stress to family life, and slowly killing our country's future competitiveness. Yet even so, we still want our kids to score off the charts on every test they take, in elementary school and beyond. And there will be a lot of them. How do we preserve space for self-directed learning and development, while also asking our children to make the score and make a mark? This book is an exploration of that dilemma, and a strategy for how to solve it. The Test explores all sides of this problem-where these tests came from, why they're here to stay, and ultimately what you as a parent or teacher can do. It introduces a set of strategies borrowed from fields as diverse as games, neuroscience, social psychology, and ancient philosophy to help children do as well as they can on tests, and, just as important, how to use the experience of test-taking to do better in life. Like Paul Tough's bestseller How Children Succeed, it illuminates the emerging science of grit, curiosity and motivation, but takes a step further to explore innovations in education-emerging solutions to the over-testing crisis-that are not widely known but that you can adapt today, at home and at school. And it presents the stories of families of all kinds who are maneuvering within and beyond the existing educational system, playing and winning the testing game. You'll learn, for example, what Bill Gates, a strong public proponent of testing, does to stoke self-directed curiosity in his children, and how Mackenzie Bezos, wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and mother of three, creates individualized learning experiences for each of her children. All parents want their children to be successful, and their schools to deliver true opportunities. Yet these goals are often as likely to result in stress and arguments as actual progress. The Test is a book to help us think about these problems, and ultimately, move our own children towards the future we want for them, from elementary to high school and beyond.\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"891185661","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":677,"ControlNumber":"912138","Title":"The 5 choices : the path to extraordinary productivity","Author":"Kogon, Kory, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Simon & Schuster hardcover edition","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"1476711712","Description":"vii, 266 pages : illustrations, 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Franklin Covey offers powerful insights drawn from the latest neuroscience and decades of experience and research in the time-management field to help you master your attention and energy management through five fundamental choices that will increase your ability to achieve what matters most to you.

When she left New York on her final voyage, she sailed from the New World to the Old; yet an encounter with the machinery of the New World, in the form of a primitive German U-Boat, sent her - and her gilded passengers - to their tragic deaths and opened up a new era of indiscriminate warfare. A hundred years after her sinking, Lusitania remains an evocative ship of mystery. Was she carrying munitions that exploded? Did Winston Churchill engineer a conspiracy that doomed the liner? Lost amid these tangled skeins is the romantic, vibrant, and finally heartrending tale of the passengers who sailed aboard her. Lives, relationships, and marriages ended in the icy waters off the Irish Sea; those who survived were left haunted and plagued with guilt. Now, authors Greg King and Penny Wilson resurrect this lost, glittering world to show the golden age of travel and illuminate the most prominent of Lusitania's passengers.

Beginning with the opening \"Proem\" (prologue poem)--\"I am a Negro: \/ Black as the night is black, \/ Black like the depths of my Africa\"--Hughes spoke directly, intimately, and powerfully of the experiences of African Americans at a time when their voices were newly being heard in our literature. As the legendary Carl Van Vechten wrote in a brief introduction to the original 1926 edition, \"His cabaret songs throb with the true jazz rhythm; his sea-pieces ache with a calm, melancholy lyricism; he cries bitterly from the heart of his race. Always, however, his stanzas are subjective, personal,\" and, he concludes, they are the expression of \"an essentially sensitive and subtly illusive nature.\" That illusive nature darts among these early lines and begins to reveal itself, with precocious confidence and clarity. In a new introduction to the work, the poet and editor Kevin Young suggests that Hughes from this very first moment is \"celebrating, critiquing, and completing the American dream,\" and that he manages to take Walt Whitman's American \"I\" and write himself into it. We find here not only such classics as \"The Negro Speaks of Rivers\" and the great twentieth-century anthem that begins \"I, too, sing America,\" but also the poet's shorter lyrics and fancies, which dream just as deeply. \"Bring me all of your \/ Heart melodies,\" the young Hughes offers, \"That I may wrap them \/ In a blue cloud-cloth \/ Away from the too-rough fingers \/ Of the world.\"\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"897437057","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":692,"ControlNumber":"912253","Title":"Mrs. Grant and Madame Jule : a novel","Author":"Chiaverini, Jennifer, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780525954293","Description":"386 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"ftp:\/\/ppftpuser:welcome@ftp01.penguingroup.com\/Booksellers and Media\/Covers\/2008_2009_New_Covers\/9780525954293.jpg","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"FICTION CHI","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":1,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":30,"SystemItemsTotal":36,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"In 1844, Missouri belle Julia Dent met dazzling horseman Lieutenant Ulysses S Grant. Four years passed before their parents permitted them to wed, and the groom's abolitionist family refused to attend the ceremony. Since childhood, Julia owned as a slave another Julia, known as Jule. Jule guarded her mistress's closely held twin secrets: She had perilously poor vision but was gifted with prophetic sight. So it was that Jule became Julia's eyes to the world. And what a world it was, marked by gathering clouds of war. The Grants vowed never to be separated, but as Ulysses rose through the ranks--becoming general in chief of the Union Army--so did the stakes of their pact. During the war, Julia would travel, often in the company of Jule and the four Grant children, facing unreliable transportation and certain danger to be at her husband's side. Yet Julia and Jule saw two different wars. While Julia spoke out for women--Union and Confederate--she continued to hold Jule as a slave behind Union lines. Upon the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, Jule claimed her freedom and rose to prominence as a businesswoman in her own right, taking the honorary title Madame. The two women's paths continued to cross throughout the Grants' White House years in Washington, DC, and later in New York City, the site of Grant's Tomb\" -- from publisher's web site.","OCLC":"881888100","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":693,"ControlNumber":"912255","Title":"Where all light tends to go","Author":"Joy, David, 1983-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780399172779 (hardback)","Description":"260 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"ftp:\/\/ppftpuser:welcome@ftp01.penguingroup.com\/Booksellers and Media\/Covers\/2008_2009_New_Covers\/9780399172779.jpg","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":10,"SystemItemsTotal":10,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\" \"Lyrical, propulsive, dark and compelling.

The area surrounding Cashiers, North Carolina, is home to people of all kinds, but the world that Jacob McNeely lives in is crueler than most. His father runs a methodically organized meth ring, with local authorities on the dime to turn a blind eye to his dealings. Having dropped out of high school and cut himself off from his peers, Jacob has been working for this father for years, all on the promise that his payday will come eventually. The only joy he finds comes from reuniting with Maggie, his first love, and a girl clearly bound for bigger and better things than their hardscrabble town. Jacob has always been resigned to play the cards that were dealt him, but when a fatal mistake changes everything, he's faced with a choice: stay and appease his father, or leave the mountains with the girl he loves.

On the down side, Mrs. Berns books them--much to Mira's dismay--on the Valentine Train, a place for singles to meet and mingle. After a few glasses of champagne and Mrs. Berns' encouragement, Mira begins to relax and enjoy herself--until a fellow passenger is murdered and a snowstorm traps the train in the Rockies.","OCLC":"890807682","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Lourey, Jess, 1970- Murder-by-month mystery.","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Lourey, Jess, 1970- Murder-by-month mystery.\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":702,"ControlNumber":"912280","Title":"Dead spots","Author":"Frater, Rhiannon, author.","Publisher":"New York : Tor Books, 2015.","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"0765337150 (PAP)","Description":"412 pages ; 21 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"The stillbirth of Mackenzie's son destroyed her marriage.

But the lawbreaker he pulls over is anything but typical. From her mile-long legs to her razor-sharp wit, Maisa Bradley is like nothing Coot Lake, Minnesota, has ever seen...and she's about to take Sam on the ride of his life. Being bad has its benefits. Whoever said blood is thicker than water probably wasn't related to a former Russian mobster. But an innocent mix-up and rumors of stolen diamonds soon have the Russian mob taking an unusual interest in the sleepy little town--and Maisa facing heated scrutiny from a certain tall, dark, and handsome deputy. Sam's dazzling blue eyes beg her to reveal all her secrets, but how much should she tell?

If you suffered childhood physical or sexual abuse, you may experience such intense feelings of shame that it almost seems to define you as a person. In order to begin healing, it's important for you to know that it wasn't your fault. In this gentle guide, therapist and childhood abuse expert Beverly Engel presents a mindfulness and compassion-based therapeutic approach to help you overcome the debilitating shame that keeps you tied to the past. By following the step-by-step exercises in this book, you'll gain a greater understanding of the root cause of your shame. And by cultivating compassion toward yourself, you will begin to heal and move past your painful experiences. Recent studies show that trauma survivors, particularly those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from abuse, can greatly benefit from incorporating elements of self-compassion into their treatment. Furthermore, the practice of self-compassion has been shown to decrease PTSD symptoms, including, self-criticism, thought suppression, and rumination. This book is based on the author's powerful and effective Compassion Cure program. With this book, you will develop the skills needed to finally put a stop the crippling self-blame that keeps you from moving on and being happy. You'll learn to focus on your strengths, your courage, and your extraordinary ability to survive. Most of all, you'll learn to replace shame with its counter emotion-pride\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"867765868","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":732,"ControlNumber":"912730","Title":"So you've been publicly shamed","Author":"Ronson, Jon, 1967-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781594487132 (hardback)","Description":"290 pages illustrations ; 22 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":13,"SystemItemsTotal":17,"CurrentHoldRequests":1,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"For the past three years, Jon Ronson has been immersing himself in the world of modern-day public shaming--meeting famous shamees, shamers, and bystanders who have been impacted.

Beam finds himself on the run after killing a man who was trying to rob him, a man who turns out to be the son of Loat Duncan, a powerful local businessman and cold-blooded killer. With Loat--who is hiding a devastating secret about Beam's past--and Elvis, the local sheriff, hot on his trail, Beam leads a nomadic existence as he descends deeper into his own heart of darkness, slipping from one place to the next, each more mysterious than the last. The people he meets during his journey--an enigmatic trucker dressed in a suit, a cemetery-dwelling Good Samaritan, an armless brothel owner--are pieces of a puzzle that hold the key to Beam's past, as well as his possible future salvation.

As the city bakes, Struan finds himself tangled in a midsummer's dream of mistaken identity, giddying property prices, wild swimming, and overwhelming passions. For everyone, it is to be a life-changing summer. Meeting the English is a bright book about dark subjects--a tale about kindness and its limits, told with love.

The widow of one victim, herself now running for governor, has received an anonymous threat--a newspaper clipping from that fateful day, along with the chilling words \"I'm back.\" Florida detective Cab Bolton agrees to investigate the threat against this candidate, Diane Fairmont: an attractive politician who has a complicated history with Cab's mother, Hollywood actress Tarla Bolton--and with Cab himself. But by doing so, Cab is entering dangerous waters. Fairmont's political party is itself swamped in secrecy--a fact that, unknown to Cab, has led one of its junior staff to start asking very sensitive questions about the death of a party employee. Both Cab and this young researcher, Peach Piper, are digging up the kind of dirt that ten years can't wash away. And as the powerful crosswinds of state politics swirl around Cab and Peach, and the threat of a tropical storm hangs over Florida, this whirlwind of pressure and chaos will ultimately unearth a poisonous conspiracy and reawaken a killer who has lain dormant for a decade.","OCLC":"903902289","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Cab Bolton novels ; 2","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Cab Bolton novels ; 2\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":777,"ControlNumber":"913034","Title":"Lamentation","Author":"Sansom, C.

Summer, 1546. King Henry VIII is slowly, painfully dying. His Protestant and Catholic councilors are engaged in a final and decisive power struggle; whoever wins will control the government. As heretics are hunted across London, and radical Protestants are burned at the stake, the Catholic party focuses its attack on Henry's sixth wife--and Matthew Shardlake's old mentor--Queen Catherine Parr. Shardlake, still haunted by his narrow escape from death the year before, steps into action when the beleaguered and desperate Queen summons him to Whitehall Palace to help her recover a dangerous manuscript. The Queen has authored a confessional book, Lamentation of a Sinner, so radically Protestant that if it came to the King's attention it could bring both her and her sympathizers crashing down. Although the secret book was kept hidden inside a locked chest in the Queen's private chamber, it has inexplicably vanished. Only one page has been recovered--clutched in the hand of a murdered London printer. Shardlake's investigations take him on a trail that begins among the backstreet printshops of London, but leads him and his trusty assistant Jack Barak into the dark and labyrinthine world of court politics, a world Shardlake swore never to enter again. In this crucible of power and ambition, Protestant friends can be as dangerous as Catholic enemies, and those with shifting allegiances can be the most dangerous of all\" -- provided by publisher.","OCLC":"903247275","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Sansom, C.

Michael Paterniti is one of the most original and empathic storytellers working today. His writing has been described as \"humane, devastating, and beautiful\" by Elizabeth Gilbert, \"spellbinding\" by Anthony Doerr, and \"expansive and joyful\" by George Saunders. In the seventeen wide-ranging essays collected for the first time in Love and Other Ways of Dying, he brings his full literary powers to bear, pondering happiness and grief, memory and the redemptive power of human connection. In the remote Ukranian countryside, Paterniti picks apples (and faces mortality) with a real-life giant; in Nanjing, China, he confronts a distraught jumper on a suicide bridge; in Dodge City, Kansas, he takes up residence at a roadside hotel and sees, firsthand, the ways in which the racial divide turns neighbor against neighbor. In each instance, Paterniti illuminates the full spectrum of human experience, introducing us to unforgettable everyday people and bygone legends, exploring the big ideas and emotions that move us. Paterniti reenacts François Mitterrand's last meal in a rustic dining room in France and drives across America with Albert Einstein's brain in the trunk of his rental car, floating in a Tupperware container. He delves with heartbreaking detail into the aftermath of a plane crash off the coast of Nova Scotia, an earthquake in Haiti, and a tsunami in Japan--and, in searing swirls of language, unearths the complicated, hidden truths these moments of extremity teach us about our ability to endure, and to love. Michael Paterniti has spent the past two decades grappling with some of our most powerful subjects and incomprehensible events, taking an unflinching point of view that seeks to edify as it resists easy answers. At every turn, his work attempts to make sense of both love and loss, and leaves us with a profound sense of what it means to be human. As he writes in the Introduction to this book, \"The more we examine the grooves and scars of this life, the more free and complete we become.\" Praise for Michael Paterniti \"A fearless, spellbinding collection of inquiries by a brilliant, globally minded essayist whose writing is magic and whose worldview brims with compassion. Genius chefs, an eight-and-a-half-foot-tall giant, an earthquake, a jet crash, and a president who eats songbirds--the size of Michael Paterniti's curiosity is matched only by the size of his heart.\"--Anthony Doerr, author of All the Light We Cannot See \"Michael Paterniti is a genius.\"--Elizabeth Gilbert, author of The Signature of All Things \"Michael Paterniti is one of the best living practitioners of the art of literary journalism, able to fully elucidate and humanize the everyday and the epic. In his hands, every subject, every moment of personal or global upheaval, is treated with the same curiosity, respect, empathy, and clear-eyed wisdom.\"--Dave Eggers, author of The Circle \"I have been waiting years for this collection. In each of these essays, Michael Paterniti unveils life for us, the beauty and heartbreak of it, as we would never see it ourselves but now can never forget it. Paterniti is brilliant--a rare master--and one of my favorite authors on earth.\"--Lily King, author of Euphoria\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"900608979","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":781,"ControlNumber":"913047","Title":"There was a little girl [large print] : the real story of my mother and me","Author":"Shields, Brooke, 1965-","Publisher":"","Edition":"Large print edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781410476647 (hardcover)","Description":"633 pages (large print) : illustrations ; 23 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"2701","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":27,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":6,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"893721505","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"[large print] :","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Thorndike Press large print nonfiction series.","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Thorndike Press large print nonfiction series.\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":782,"ControlNumber":"913048","Title":"Operation Chowhound : the most risky, most glorious US bomber mission of WWII","Author":"Dando-Collins, Stephen, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781137279637 (hbk.)","Description":"xiv, 248 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, maps ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"881437069","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":783,"ControlNumber":"913060","Title":"Analytical psychology in exile : the correspondence of C.G.

It was a logical question, since rock criticism didn't yet exist. In the weekly column he would produce for the Voice, Goldstein became the first person to write regularly in a major publication about the music that changed our lives. He believed deeply in the power of rock, and, long before it was acceptable, he championed the idea that this music was a serious art form. From his unique position in journalism, he saw the full arc of events that shaped culture and politics in the 1960s--and participated in them, too. He toured with Janis Joplin, spent a day at the Grateful Dead house in San Francisco, and dropped acid with Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. He was present for Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, the student uprising at Columbia, and the riots at the 1968 Democratic Convention. He was challenged to a boxing match by Norman Mailer, and took Susan Sontag to her first disco. Goldstein developed close relationships with several rock legends--Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, to name two--and their early deaths came as a wrenching shock, fueling his disillusionment as he watched the music he loved rapidly evolve from a communal rite to a vast industry--and the sense of hope for radical social upheaval fade away. Another Little Piece of My Heart is the intimate memoir of the writer as a young man with profound ambition. It is also a sweeping personal account of a decade that no one else could provide--a deeply moving, unparalleled document of rock and revolution in America\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"884571056","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":785,"ControlNumber":"913067","Title":"The death of Caesar : the story of history's most famous assassination","Author":"Strauss, Barry S.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Simon & Schuster hardcover edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781451668797","Description":"xx, 323 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, maps ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"937.05 STR","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":6,"SystemItemsTotal":10,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"883147929","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":786,"ControlNumber":"913070","Title":"The creator's code : the six essential skills of extraordinary entrepreneurs","Author":"Wilkinson, Amy, 1972- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Simon & Schuster hardcover edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781451666052 (hbk.)","Description":"viii, 228 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Based on in-depth interviews with more than 200 leading entrepreneurs, [including the founders of LinkedIn, Chipotle, eBay, Under Armour, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, Spanx, Airbnb, PayPal, JetBlue, Gilt Group, Theranos, and Dropbox], a business executive and senior fellow at [the Harvard Kennedy School] identifies the six essential disciplines needed to transform your ideas into real-world successes, whether you're an innovative manager or an aspiring entrepreneur\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"880960081","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":787,"ControlNumber":"912890","Title":"I am not a slut : slut-shaming in the age of the Internet","Author":"Tanenbaum, Leora, 1969-","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780062282590","Description":"xx, 387 pages ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"The author of the groundbreaking work Slut! explores the phenomenon of slut-shaming in the age of sexting, tweeting, and \"liking.\" She shows that the sexual double standard is more dangerous than ever before and offers wisdom and strategies for alleviating its destructive effects on young women's lives. Young women are encouraged to express themselves sexually. Yet when they do, they are derided as \"sluts.\" Caught in a double bind of mixed sexual messages, young women are confused. To fulfill the contradictory roles of being sexy but not slutty, they create an \"experienced\" identity on social media-even if they are not sexually active - while ironically referring to themselves and their friends as \"sluts.\" But this strategy can become a weapon used against young women in the hands of peers who circulate rumors and innuendo - elevating age-old slut-shaming to deadly levels, with suicide among bullied teenage girls becoming increasingly common. Now, Leora Tanenbaum revisits her influential work on sexual stereotyping to offer fresh insight into the digital and face-to-face worlds contemporary young women inhabit. She shares her new research, involving interviews with a wide range of teenage girls and young women from a variety of backgrounds as well as parents, educators, and academics.

England is engulfed in war as King Stephen and his cousin, the Empress Matilda, vie for the crown. In this dangerous world, not even Emma, an eleven-year-old peasant, is safe. A depraved monk obsessed with redheads kidnaps the ginger-haired girl from her village and leaves her for dead. When an archer for hire named Gwyl finds her, she has no memory of her previous life. Unable to abandon her, Gwyl takes the girl with him, dressing her as a boy, giving her a new name--Penda--and teaching her to use a bow. But Gwyn knows that the man who hurt Penda roams free, and that a scrap of evidence she possesses could be very valuable. Gwyl and Penda make their way to Kenilworth, a small but strategically important fortress that belongs to fifteen-year-old Maud. Newly wedded to a boorish and much older husband after her father's death, the fierce and determined young chatelaine tempts fate and Stephen's murderous wrath when she gives shelter to the empress. Aided by a garrison of mercenaries, including Gwyl and his odd red-headed apprentice, Maud will stave off Stephen's siege for a long, brutal winter that will bring a host of visitors to Kenilworth--kings, soldiers . . . and a sinister monk with deadly business to finish\" -- from publisher's web site.","OCLC":"891155766","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":794,"ControlNumber":"912923","Title":"Walking on trampolines","Author":"Whiting, Frances.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Gallery Books trade paperback edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781476780016 (trade pbk.)","Description":"337 pages ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"881824403","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":795,"ControlNumber":"912925","Title":"Who buries the dead : a Sebastian St. Cyr mystery","Author":"Harris, C.

S. Harris's \"troubled but compelling antihero\" (Booklist) to the ultimate test in this taut, thrilling mystery.  London, 1813. The vicious decapitation of Stanley Preston, a wealthy, socially ambitious plantation owner, at Bloody Bridge draws Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, into a macabre and increasingly perilous investigation. The discovery near the body of an aged lead coffin strap bearing the inscription King Charles, 1648 suggests a link between this killing and the beheading of the deposed seventeenth-century Stuart monarch. Equally troubling, the victim's kinship to the current Home Secretary draws the notice of Sebastian's powerful father-in-law, Lord Jarvis, who will exploit any means to pursue his own clandestine ends.  Working in concert with his fiercely independent wife, Hero, Sebastian finds his inquiries taking him from the wretched back alleys of Fish Street Hill to the glittering ballrooms of Mayfair as he amasses a list of suspects who range from an eccentric Chelsea curiosity collector to the brother of an unassuming but brilliantly observant spinster named Jane Austen.  But as one brutal murder follows another, it is the connection between the victims and ruthless former army officer Sinclair, Lord Oliphant, that dramatically raises the stakes. Once, Oliphant nearly destroyed Sebastian in a horrific wartime act of carnage and betrayal. Now the vindictive former colonel might well pose a threat not only to Sebastian but to everything-and everyone-Sebastian holds most dear.  \"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"903898355","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Harris, C.

For over two years, Thomas has avoided his clan's estate because it borders Lucilla's home, but disturbing reports from his clansmen force him to return to the countryside, only to discover that his uncle, the laird, is ailing, a clan family is desperately ill, and the clan healer is unconscious and dying. Duty to the clan leaves Thomas no choice but to seek help from the last woman he wants to face. Strong-willed and passionate, Lucilla has been waiting for Thomas to return and claim his rightful place by her side. He is the only man for her, just as she is his one true love. And, at last, he's back. Thomas can never forget Lucilla, much less the connection that seethes between them, but to marry her would mean embracing a life he's adamant he does not want.

Somehow, a rescue attempt staged from the inside went terribly wrong and everyone on board was killed. Members of the CIA stationed in Vienna during that time were witness to this terrible tragedy, gathering intel from their sources during those tense hours, assimilating facts from the ground with a series of texts coming from one of their agents inside the plane. So when it all went wrong, the question had to be asked: Had their agent been compromised, and how? Two of those agents, Henry Pelham and Celia Harrison, were lovers at the time, and in fact that was the last night they spent together. Until now. That night Celia decided she'd had enough; she left the agency, married and had children, and is living an ordinary life in the suburbs. Henry is still an analyst, and has traveled to California to see her one more time, to relive the past, maybe, or to put it behind him once and for all. But neither of them can forget that long-ago question: Had their agent been compromised, and how? And each of them also wonders what role tonight's dinner companion might have played in the way things unfolded.

On an unremarkable night, Jose; Victoriano Arteaga--the head of a thriving Mexico City family--vanishes on his way home from work. The Arteagas find few answers; the full truth of what happened to Arteaga is lost to the shadows of Mexico's vast and desperate underworld, a place of rampant violence and kidnappings, and government corruption. But soon packages arrive to the family house, offering horrifying clues. Fear, guilt, and the prospect of financial ruination fracture the once-proud family and scatter them across the globe, yet delicate threads still hold them together: in a swimming pool in Palo Alto, Arteaga's young grandson struggles to make sense of the grief that has hobbled his family; in Mexico City, Arteaga's mistress alternates between rage and heartbreak as she waits, in growing panic, for her lover's return; in Austin, the Arteagas' housekeeper tries to piece together a second life in an alienating and demeaning new land; in Madrid, Arteaga's son takes his ailing dog through the hot and unforgiving streets, in search of his father's ghost.

So when animal behaviorist expert Pru Marlowe gets a call about a kitten, she doesn't expect to find the cuddly creature playing beside the cooling body of prominent Beauville lawyer David Canaday.

While the cause of death is pending, each sister has an axe to grind--with arguments that escalate when David's partner reads out the will. Pru's special sensitivity to animals, which caused her to flee the cacophony of Manhattan for the quiet Berkshires, adds further problems. The local vet is overwhelmed as the animal hospital's money runs out. There's a needy Sheltie and some invasive squirrels, too. But the dead man's kitten, his former partner, and his troublesome family keep drawing \"wild-girl\" animal psychic Pru back in. Despite the wry observations of her trusty tabby Wallis, now the wrongfully accused kitten's guardian, and the grudging compliance of her cop lover, this may be one time when Pru can't solve the mystery or save the kitten she wants to believe is innocent. A single witness knows the truth about that bright spring morning.

The Voyager spacecraft are our farthest-flung emissaries-11.3 billion miles away from the crew who built and still operate them, decades since their launch. Voyager 1 left the solar system in 2012; its sister craft, Voyager 2, will do so in 2015. The fantastic journey began in 1977, before the first episode of Cosmos aired. The mission was planned as a grand tour beyond the moon; beyond Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; and maybe even into interstellar space. The fact that it actually happened makes this humanity's greatest space mission. In The Interstellar Age, award-winning planetary scientist Jim Bell reveals what drove and continues to drive the members of this extraordinary team, including Ed Stone, Voyager's chief scientist and the one-time head of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab; Charley Kohlhase, an orbital dynamics engineer who helped to design many of the critical slingshot maneuvers around planets that enabled the Voyagers to travel so far; and the geologist whose Earth-bound experience would prove of little help in interpreting the strange new landscapes revealed in the Voyagers' astoundingly clear images of moons and planets. Speeding through space at a mind-bending eleven miles a second, Voyager 1 is now beyond our solar system's planets. It carries with it artifacts of human civilization. By the time Voyager passes its first star in about 40,000 years, the gold record on the spacecraft, containing various music and images including Chuck Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode,\" will still be playable\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881888108","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":870,"ControlNumber":"914045","Title":"17 carnations : the royals, the Nazis and the biggest cover-up in history","Author":"Morton, Andrew, 1953- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781455527113","Description":"xii, 370 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":15,"SystemItemsTotal":19,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"885207200","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":871,"ControlNumber":"914048","Title":"Arts & crafts furniture projects","Author":"Paolini, Gregory,, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781600857812 (pbk.)","Description":"170 pages : color illustrations ; 28 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"A skill-building guide featuring 9 ... projects\"--Cover.","OCLC":"881041396","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":872,"ControlNumber":"914049","Title":"Cold betrayal : an Ali Reynolds novel","Author":"Jance, Judith A.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Touchstone hardcover edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781476745046 (hardback)","Description":"337 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"MCN FICTION JAN","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":2,"LocalItemsTotal":3,"SystemItemsIn":31,"SystemItemsTotal":43,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Revenge isn't the only dish served cold...

With the advent of massive open online courses (\"MOOCS\") over the past two years, predictions that higher education will be the next industry to undergo \"disruption\" have become more frequent and fervent. Currently a university's reputation relies heavily on the \"four Rs\" in which the most elite schools thrive--rankings, research, real estate, and rah! (i.e. sports). But for the majority of students who are not attending these elite institutions, the \"four Rs\" offer poor value for the expense of a college education. Craig sees the future of higher education in online degrees that unbundle course offerings to offer a true bottom line return for the majority of students in terms of graduation, employment, and wages. College Disrupted details the changes that American higher education will undergo, including the transformation from packaged courses and degrees to truly unbundled course offerings, along with those that it will not. Written by a professional at the only investment firm focused on the higher education market, College Disrupted takes a creative view of the forces roiling higher education and the likely outcome, including light-hearted, real-life anecdotes that illustrate the author's points. \"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881437112","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":874,"ControlNumber":"914051","Title":"Core Java for the impatient","Author":"Horstmann, Cay S., 1959- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780321996329","Description":"xxv, 480 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":1,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"The release of Java SE 8 introduced significant enhancements that impact the Core Java technologies and APIs at the heart of the Java platform. Many old Java idioms are no longer required and new features like lambda expressions will increase programmer productivity, but navigating these changes can be challenging. Core Java for the Impatient is a complete but concise guide to Java SE 8. Written by Cay Horstmann -- the author of Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient and Core Java, the classic, two-volume introduction to the Java language -- this indispensable new tutorial offers a faster, easier pathway for learning the language and libraries. Given the size of the language and the scope of the new features introduced in Java SE 8, there's plenty of material to cover, but it's presented in small chunks organized for quick access and easy understanding. If you're an experienced programmer, Horstmann's practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of lambda expressions (closures), streams, and other Java language and platform improvements. Horstmann covers everything developers need to know about modern Java, including: Crisp and effective coverage of lambda expressions, enabling you to express actions with a concise syntax; A thorough introduction to the new streams API, which makes working with data far more flexible and efficient; A treatment of concurrent programming that encourages you to design your programs in terms of cooperating tasks instead of low-level threads and locks; Up-to-date coverage of new libraries like Date and Time; Other new features that will be especially valuable for server-side or mobile programmers . Whether you are just getting started with modern Java or are an experienced developer, this guide will be invaluable for anyone who wants to write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure Java code. - Publisher.","OCLC":"869263082","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":875,"ControlNumber":"914059","Title":"Girl in the dark : a memoir","Author":"Lyndsey, Anna, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First American editon.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780385539609","Description":"258 pages ; 20 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":5,"SystemItemsTotal":6,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Anna was living a normal life. She was ambitious and worked hard; she had just bought an apartment; she was falling in love. But then she started to develop worrying symptoms: her face felt like it was burning whenever she was in front of the computer. Soon this progressed to an intolerance of fluorescent light, then of sunlight itself. The reaction soon spread to her entire body. Now, when her symptoms are at their worst she must spend months on end in a blacked-out room, losing herself in audio books and elaborate word games in an attempt to ward off despair. During periods of relative remission she can venture cautiously out at dawn and dusk, into a world which, from the perspective of her normally cloistered existence, is filled with a remarkable beauty. And throughout there is her relationship with Pete. In many ways he is Anna's savior, offering her shelter from the light in his home. But she cannot enjoy a normal life with him, cannot go out in the day, even making love is uniquely awkward. Anna asks herself \"by continuing to occupy this lovely man while giving him neither children, nor a public companion, nor a welcoming home - do I do wrong?\" With gorgeous, lyrical prose, Anna brings us into the dark with her, a place from which we emerge to see love, and the world, anew\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881436918","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":876,"ControlNumber":"914063","Title":"Loving learning : how progressive education can save America's schools","Author":"Little, Tom, 1953-2014.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780393246162 (hardcover)","Description":"254 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":4,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"880566135","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":877,"ControlNumber":"914064","Title":"Moody bitches : the truth about the drugs you're taking, the sleep you're missing, the sex you're not having, and what's really making you crazy","Author":"Holland, Julie, 1965-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781594205804","Description":"420 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":7,"SystemItemsTotal":10,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"As women, we learn from an early age that our moods are a problem. To succeed in life, we are told, we must have it all under control: we have to tamp down our inherent shifts in favor of a more static way of being. But our bodies are wiser than we imagine. Moods are not an annoyance to be stuffed away, they are a finely-tuned feedback system that can tell us how best to manage our lives. Our changing moods let us know when our bodies are primed to tackle different challenges and when we should be alert to developing problems. They help us select the right tool for each of our many jobs. If we deny our emotionality, we deny the breadth of our talents. With the right care of our inherently dynamic bodies, we can master our moods to avail ourselves of this great natural strength. Yet millions of American women are medicating away their emotions because our culture says that moodiness is a problem to be fixed. Over-prescribed medications can have devastating consequences for women in many areas of our lives--and even if we don't pop a pill, women everywhere are numbing their emotions with food, alcohol, and a host of addictive behaviors that deny the wisdom of our bodies and keep us from addressing the real issues that we face. Here, Dr. Julie Holland shares a better way.--From publisher description.","OCLC":"891185823","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":878,"ControlNumber":"914065","Title":"More monster knits for little monsters : 20 super-cute animal-themed hat and mitten sets to knit","Author":"Khegay, Nuriya, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First U.S. edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781250053527 (pbk.)","Description":"144 pages : color illustrations ; 25 cm","WebLink":"http:\/\/www.netread.com\/jcusers2\/bk1388\/527\/9781250053527\/image\/lgcover.9781250053527.jpg","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"This new collection of 20 animal-themed hat and mitten sets in practical pullover designs features bears; safari animals like zebras and monkeys; farmyard friends such as lambs and turkeys; household pets including a black cat and spotty dog; and even beastly BFFs like dinosaurs, gnomes, and a Chinese New Year dragon!

It's the American dream: get a good education, work hard, buy a house, and achieve prosperity and success. This is the America we believe in--a nation of opportunity, constrained only by ability and effort. But during the last twenty-five years we have seen a disturbing \"opportunity gap\" emerge. Americans have always believed in equality of opportunity, the idea that all kids, regardless of their family background, should have a decent chance to improve their lot in life. Now, this central tenet of the American dream seems no longer true or at the least, much less true than it was. Robert Putnam--about whom The Economist said, \"his scholarship is wide-ranging, his intelligence luminous, his tone modest, his prose unpretentious and frequently funny\"--offers a personal but also authoritative look at this new American crisis. Putnam begins with his high school class of 1959 in Port Clinton, Ohio. By and large the vast majority of those students--\"our kids\"--went on to lives better than those of their parents. But their children and grandchildren have had harder lives amid diminishing prospects. Putnam tells the tale of lessening opportunity through poignant life stories of rich and poor kids from cities and suburbs across the country, drawing on a formidable body of research done especially for this book. Our Kids is a rare combination of individual testimony and rigorous evidence. Putnam provides a disturbing account of the American dream that should initiate a deep examination of the future of our country\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"883148125","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":886,"ControlNumber":"914085","Title":"Rust : the longest war","Author":"Waldman, Jonathan.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Simon & Schuster hardcover edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781451691597 (hardcover)","Description":"xii, 288 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":8,"SystemItemsTotal":9,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"An environmental journalist traces the historical war against rust, revealing how rust-related damage costs more than all other natural disasters combined and how it is combated by industrial workers, the government, universities, and everyday people.","OCLC":"883147999","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":887,"ControlNumber":"913910","Title":"Homemakers : a domestic handbook for the digital generation","Author":"Morin, Brit, 1985-","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780062332509","Description":"437 pages : color illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":5,"SystemItemsTotal":5,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Brit Morin, founder of the wildly popular lifestyle brand, app, and website Brit + Co, reimagines homemaking for the twenty-first century, making it as simple as possible to go from amateur to pro with easy charts, tips, recipes, DIY projects, and tech shortcuts.

The key, according to Paul B. Brown, is to think like an entrepreneur, no matter what your position or industry. What works for the most successful entrepreneurs will work for us, Brown argues, whether we want to stay employed working for someone else or are thinking of going off on our own. Based on extensive research, Entrepreneurship for the Rest of Us reveals the best practices of the most successful entrepreneurs, those who are adept at continually innovating and seeing opportunity where others do not. They do that by following a rigid approach. For example: They never start with a new idea, but by trying to solve a market need. Financing is an afterthought. They get started with the resources at hand (not only does that allow them to move quickly, if things don't work out, they are not out much). Perfect is the enemy of good, it is much more important to get out into the marketplace with a prototype than to keep fiddling with what you have. In short, the entrepreneurial mindset is a protection against economic uncertainty, and Brown's goal is to spread that thinking to individuals and large organizations alike. Though of course we won't all start or run our own companies, we need to learn to think like entrepreneurs so that when uncertainty hits, as it will again and again, individuals and companies will be better prepared to not only survive but win\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"884815122","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":901,"ControlNumber":"914175","Title":"Real war vs. reel war : veterans, Hollywood, and WWII","Author":"Broderick, Suzanne, 1948-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781442245556 (hardback : alk. paper)","Description":"xii, 159 pages ; 23 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"892514340","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"Film and history","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"SE=\"Film and history\"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":902,"ControlNumber":"914177","Title":"The last unicorn : a search for one of Earth's rarest creatures","Author":"DeBuys, William, 1949- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780316232869 (hardback)","Description":"354 pages : illustrations, maps ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"In 1992, in a remote mountain range, a team of scientists discovered the remains of an unusual animal with beautiful long horns.

A few years ago, Mark Adams made a strange discovery: Everything we know about the lost city of Atlantis comes from the work of one man, the Greek philosopher Plato. Then he made a second, stranger discovery: Amateur explorers are still actively searching for this sunken city all around the world, based entirely on the clues Plato left behind. Exposed to the Atlantis obsession, Adams decides to track down these people and determine why they believe it's possible to find the world's most famous lost city and whether any of their theories could prove or disprove its existence. He visits scientists who use cutting-edge technology to find legendary civilizations once thought to be fictional. He examines the numerical and musical codes hidden in Plato's writings, and with the help of some charismatic sleuths traces their roots back to Pythagoras, the sixth-century BC mathematician. He learns how ancient societies transmitted accounts of cataclysmic events--and how one might dig out the 'kernel of truth' in Plato's original tale. Meet Me in Atlantis is Adams's enthralling account of his quest to solve one of history's greatest mysteries; a travelogue that takes readers to fascinating locations to meet irresistible characters; and a deep, often humorous look at the human longing to rediscover a lost world\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881888102","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":904,"ControlNumber":"914181","Title":"The barefoot lawyer : a blind man's fight for justice and freedom in China","Author":"Chen, Guangcheng, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780805098051","Description":"xvi, 330 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some color), map ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":6,"SystemItemsTotal":7,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"An electrifying memoir by the blind Chinese activist who inspired millions with the story of his fight for justice and his belief in the cause of freedom.","OCLC":"877905690","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":905,"ControlNumber":"914183","Title":"Digital destiny : how the new age of data will transform the way we work, live, and communicate","Author":"DuBravac, Shawn, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"1621573737 (hardback)","Description":"xxvi, 372 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":5,"SystemItemsTotal":7,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Shawn DuBravac, chief economist and senior director of research at the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), argues that the groundswell of digital ownership unfolding in our lives signals the beginning of a new era for humanity.

But what does this mean in practice? It means that some of mankind's most pressing problems, such as hunger, disease, and security, will finally have a solution. It means that the rise of driverless cars could save thousands of American lives each year, and perhaps hundreds of thousands more around the planet. It means a departure from millennia-old practices, such as the need for urban centers. It means that massive inefficiencies, such as the supply chains in Africa allowing food to rot before it can be fed to the hungry, can be overcome. It means that individuals will have more freedom in action, work, health, and pursuits than ever before.","OCLC":"892582139","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":906,"ControlNumber":"914186","Title":"The thin green line : the money secrets of the super wealthy","Author":"Sullivan, Paul (Paul J.), author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First Simon & Schuster hardcover edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781451687248","Description":"viii, 243 pages ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"Paul Sullivan shows how people can make better financial decisions, and come to terms with what money means to them.

Do you feel at home right now? Or do you sense a hovering anxiety or uncertainty, an underlying unease that makes you feel just a bit uncomfortable, a bit distracted and disconnected from those around you? In The Road Home, Ethan Nichtern, a senior teacher in the Shambhala Buddhist tradition, investigates the journey each of us takes to find where we belong. Drawing from contemporary research on meditation and mindfulness and his experience as a Buddhist teacher and practitioner, Nichtern describes in fresh and deeply resonant terms the basic existential experience that gives rise to spiritual seeking--and also to its potentially dangerous counterpart, spiritual materialism. He reveals how our individual quests for self-awareness ripple forward into relationships, communities, and society at large. And he explains exactly how, by turning our awareness to what's happening around us and inside us, we become able to enhance our sense of connection with others and, at the same time, change for the better our individual and collective patterns of greed, apathy, and inattention. In this wise and witty invitation to Buddhist meditation, Nichtern shows how, in order to create a truly compassionate and enlightened society, we must start with ourselves. And this means beginning by working with our own minds--in whatever state we find them in\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"900608769","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":924,"ControlNumber":"914555","Title":"Virtuous violence : hurting and killing to create, sustain, end, and honor social relationships : the social-relational, moral motivational psychology, cultural anthropology and history of war, torture, genocide, animal and human sacrifice, obedience to gods, religious self-torture, homicide, robbery, intimate partner conflict, rape, suicide and self-harm, corporal and capital punishment, trial by ordeal and combat, policing, initiation, castration, fighting for status, contact sports and martial arts, honor, the Iliad and the Trojan War, injurious mortuary rites, and homicidal mourning","Author":"Fiske, Alan Page, 1947- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781107088207","Description":"xxvi, 357 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":2,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"What motivates violence? How can good and compassionate people hurt and kill others, or themselves? Why are people much more likely to kill or assault people they know well, rather than strangers?

In perpetrators' minds, violence may be the morally necessary and proper way to regulate social relationships according to cultural precepts, precedents and prototypes. These moral motivations apply equally to the violence of the heroes of the Iliad, to parents smacking their child, and many modern murders and everyday acts of violence.

It lay deeper and higher in the mountains than any other place Americans had ventured. You had to travel through a network of interlinked valleys, past all the other remote American outposts, just to get to its mouth. Stories circulated periodically, tales of land claimed and fought for, or lost and overrun, new attempts made or turned back, outposts abandoned and reclaimed. They were impossible to verify. Everything about the Valley was myth and rumor. The strung-out platoon Black finds after traveling deep into the heart of the Valley, and the illumination of the dark secrets accumulated during month after month fighting and dying in defense of an indefensible piece of land, provide a shattering portrait of men at war\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"881888109","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":939,"ControlNumber":"914726","Title":"Perfect kind of trouble","Author":"Fine, Chelsea, 1982-","Publisher":"","Edition":"First trade paperback edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781455583157 (softcover)","Description":"356 pages ; 21 cm.","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":2,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Praise for Best Kind of Broken: \"By turns humorous and heartbreaking, Best Kind Of Broken has become one of my favorites!\" --Cora Carmack, New York Times bestselling author \"You'll fall for Pixie and Levi, just like I did!\" --Jennifer L.

Four hundred years in the future, the Earth has turned primitive following a nuclear fire that has laid waste to civilization and nature. Though the radiation fallout has ended, for some unknowable reason every person is born with a twin. Of each pair, one is an Alpha--physically perfect in every way; and the other an Omega--burdened with deformity, small or large. With the Council ruling an apartheid-like society, Omegas are branded and ostracized while the Alphas have gathered the world's sparse resources for themselves. Though proclaiming their superiority, for all their effort Alphas cannot escape one harsh fact: Whenever one twin dies, so does the other. Cass is a rare Omega, one burdened with psychic foresight. While her twin, Zach, gains power on the Alpha Council, she dares to dream the most dangerous dream of all: equality. For daring to envision a world in which Alphas and Omegas live side-by-side as equals, both the Council and the Resistance have her in their sights\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"883147921","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":942,"ControlNumber":"914731","Title":"The kings of London","Author":"Shaw, William, 1959- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First North American edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780316246873","Description":"390 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"FICTION SHA","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":1,"SystemItemsIn":7,"SystemItemsTotal":9,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"While investigating a gas explosion in London, Detective Sergeant Cathal Breen and young policewoman Helen Tozer find psychedelic paintings by Bridget Riley and Peter Blake, along with the body of a playboy art collector.","OCLC":"879583444","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":943,"ControlNumber":"914733","Title":"The violent century","Author":"Tidhar, Lavie, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First U.S. edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781250064493 (hbk.)","Description":"362 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"http:\/\/www.netread.com\/jcusers2\/bk1388\/493\/9781250064493\/image\/lgcover.9781250064493.jpg","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"They never meant to be heroes.

Four weeks before their college graduation, twenty-one-year-old Kevin Schaeffer walked Amy Butcher to her home in their college town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Hours after parting ways with Amy, he fatally stabbed his ex-girlfriend, Emily Silverstein. While he was awaiting trial, psychiatrists concluded that he had suffered an acute psychotic break. Although severely affected by Kevin's crime, Amy remained devoted to him as a friend, believing that his actions were the direct result of his untreated illness. Over time, she became obsessed-determined to discover the narrative that explained what Kevin had done. The tragedy deeply shook her concept of reality, disrupted her sense of right and wrong, and dismantled every conceivable notion she'd established about herself and her relation to the world. Eventually realizing that she would never have the answers, or find personal peace, unless she went after it herself, Amy returned to Gettysburg-the first time in three years since graduation-to sift through hundred of pages of public records: mental health evaluations, detectives' notes, inventories of evidence, search warrants, testimonies, and even Kevin's own confession. Visiting Hours is Amy Butcher's deeply personal, heart-wrenching exploration of how trauma affects memory and the way a friendship changes and often strengthens through seemingly insurmountable challenges. Ultimately, it's a testament to the bonds we share with others and the profound resilience and strength of the human spirit\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"901374322","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":969,"ControlNumber":"914963","Title":"Natural meditation : a guide to effortless meditative practice","Author":"Sluyter, Dean.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780399171413","Description":"260 pages : illustrations ; 21 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":0,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"893317114","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":970,"ControlNumber":"914979","Title":"The raven","Author":"Reynard, Sylvain.","Publisher":"","Edition":"Berkley trade paperback edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780425266496 (softcover)","Description":"422 pages ; 21 cm.","WebLink":"ftp:\/\/ppftpuser:welcome@ftp01.penguingroup.com\/Booksellers and Media\/Covers\/2008_2009_New_Covers\/9780425266496.jpg","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":1,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"From the New York Times bestselling author of the Gabriel series comes a dark, sensual tale of romance in a city shrouded in mystery.

Daniel Torday's debut novel, The Last Flight of Poxl West, beautifully weaves together what it means to be a family in the shadow of war-- to love, to lose, and to heal\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"876349622","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":979,"ControlNumber":"915068","Title":"World gone by [large print]","Author":"Lehane, Dennis, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First HarperLuxe edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780062298607","Description":"421 pages (large print) ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"1","TypeOfMaterial":"2701","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":27,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":6,"SystemItemsTotal":7,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"Late spring, 1943.

If you're not made of money, where can you get an amazing liberal arts education without your parents having to remortgage the house or cash in their retirement fund? Which degrees will allow you to fulfill your dreams and earn a decent paycheck? What do you really need to know if you're the first in your family to go to college? How do you find good schools that offer a well-rounded campus life for black or Latino students? From the staff of Washington Monthly comes a new kind of college guide, inspired by and including the magazine's signature alternative college rankings. The Other College Guide features smartly designed, engaging chapters on finding the best-fit schools and the real deal about money, loans, and preparing for the world of work. This essential higher ed handbook also highlights information on what to look for (and watch out for) in online programs and for-profit colleges and concludes with fifty profiles of remarkable but frequently overlooked schools.

People are turning away from the endless drive to consume in favor of a simpler, more streamlined way of living. The shift is already underway: influential millennials favor Zipcars over owning cars, share music on Spotify, and read e-books rather than accumulating a bulky physical library. Wallman blames our obsession with \"stuff\" on the original Mad Men who first \"created desire\" through advertising, with unintended consequences that ripple through our lives today. He interviews anthropologists studying the 21st century clutter crisis, consults with scientists who have linked \"stuffocation\" to rising cortisol levels and declining psychological wellbeing, and introduces us to the innovators who are already choosing \"experience\" over \"stuff.\" A paradigm-shifting look at how and why we consume, and an inspiring manifesto for living more with less\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"891001567","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":990,"ControlNumber":"915214","Title":"The war that forged a nation : why the Civil War still matters","Author":"McPherson, James M.","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9780199375776 (hardback)","Description":"x, 219 pages ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":5,"SystemItemsTotal":5,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"More than 140 years ago, Mark Twain observed that the Civil War had 'uprooted institutions that were centuries old, changed the politics of a people, transformed the social life of half the country, and wrought so profoundly upon the entire national character that the influence cannot be measured short of two or three generations.' In fact, five generations have passed, and Americans are still trying to measure the influence of the immense fratricidal conflict that nearly tore the nation apart. In The War that Forged a Nation, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian James M. McPherson considers why the Civil War remains so deeply embedded in our national psyche and identity. The drama and tragedy of the war, from its scope and size--an estimated death toll of 750,000, far more than the rest of the country's wars combined--to the nearly mythical individuals involved--Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson--help explain why the Civil War remains a topic of interest. But the legacy of the war extends far beyond historical interest or scholarly attention. Here, McPherson draws upon his work over the past fifty years to illuminate the war's continuing resonance across many dimensions of American life. Touching upon themes that include the war's causes and consequences; the naval war; slavery and its abolition; and Lincoln as commander in chief, McPherson ultimately proves the impossibility of understanding the issues of our own time unless we first understand their roots in the era of the Civil War. From racial inequality and conflict between the North and South to questions of state sovereignty or the role of government in social change--these issues, McPherson shows, are as salient and controversial today as they were in the 1860s. Thoughtful, provocative, and authoritative, The War that Forged a Nation looks anew at the reasons America's civil war has remained a subject of intense interest for the past century and a half, and affirms the enduring relevance of the conflict for America today\"-- Provided by publisher.","OCLC":"891121613","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":991,"ControlNumber":"915215","Title":"Washington's circle : the creation of the president","Author":"Heidler, David Stephen, 1955- author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781400069279","Description":"xx, 536 pages, 16 unnumbered leaves of plates : illustrations, portraits ; 25 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":6,"SystemItemsTotal":7,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"A group portrait of America's first President and the men who served with him to create the office shares insights into their personalities and the consequences of Washington's decision to heed or disregard specific advice.","OCLC":"882530792","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":992,"ControlNumber":"915219","Title":"Gil Hodges : a hall of fame life","Author":"Zachter, Mort, 1958-","Publisher":"","Edition":"","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"0803211244","Description":"xiv, 478 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":3,"SystemItemsTotal":4,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"894747523","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":993,"ControlNumber":"915223","Title":"Canoeing wild rivers : the 30th anniversary guide to Expedition canoeing in North America","Author":"Jacobson, Cliff.","Publisher":"","Edition":"Fifth Edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"9781493008254 (alk. paper)","Description":"xi, 338 pages : color illustrations, maps ; 23 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":1,"SystemItemsTotal":3,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"","OCLC":"891608483","UPC":"","TargetAudience":"","Medium":"","ThumbnailLink":"","VernacularTitle":"","VernacularAuthor":"","VernacularPublisher":"","LocalControlNumber":null,"Series":"","SeriesSuggestedQuery":"","VernacularSeries":""},{"Position":994,"ControlNumber":"915256","Title":"American ghost : a family's haunted past in the desert southwest","Author":"Nordhaus, Hannah, author.","Publisher":"","Edition":"First edition.","PublicationDate":"2015","ISBN":"0062249215","Description":"320 pages : illustrations, maps ; 24 cm","WebLink":"","Fiction":"","TypeOfMaterial":"01","PrimaryTypeOfMaterial":1,"CallNumber":"","CourseReserveCount":0,"LocalItemsIn":0,"LocalItemsTotal":0,"SystemItemsIn":9,"SystemItemsTotal":11,"CurrentHoldRequests":0,"KWIC":"","RetentionStatement":"","HoldingsStatement":"","HoldingsNote":"","Summary":"\"In American Ghost, Hannah Nordhaus traces the life, death, and unsettled afterlife of her great-great-grandmother Julia, from her childhood in Germany to her years in the American West with her Jewish merchant husband.
